0,2025-05-25,"[Hiring] Cute anime/chibi style picture of wife and 4 pets cosplaying anime characters. Budget ~$200 Hello! I am looking for someone with interest in creating a picture of my wife and 4 pets in a cute, anime or chibi style as though they are all cosplaying as her favorite characters.

The figures would be my wife, 3 cats, and 1 dog (a shiba inu). The characters would be from Freiren and Apothecary Diaries ([Frieren, Fern, Stark](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fw8gyykkvfvxc1.jpeg), [Jinshi](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/p__/images/5/5e/The_Apocathery_Anime_Jinshi-Design_render.webp/revision/latest?cb=20231224222016&path-prefix=protagonist), and [Maomao](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/images/6/6c/Maomao-Design-Anime.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20230814074037)). 

The background and poses/positions of each I am open to discussing and hearing your ideas, but I am not looking for a very richly detailed background. Just something that seems cute, cozy, and like they are all hanging out together

I would like to have it printed for her as a gift, and would look to print something in the 8x8 range. My budget would be about $200 - $250 depending on the proposal. 

My deadline for this project is July 10.

I'll share pictures of her and the pets, as well as any other background or visual references you might need, after acceptance.

I've had great luck in the past with HungryArtists, looking forward to your proposals! Thank you!",0.2372159090909091,1,1,"Welcome to /r/hungryartists!

Happy gaming!",0.15,2,15,"Did you mean to say 700 km or was 700 m right?

There's no need to use the original packaging for transporting. If this is actually a long distance (i.e., 700 km instead of 700 m), for good measure I'd remove the graphics card before the trip, and transport it outside the PC (using the anti-static bag would be ideal, but if you don't have it, wrap it in newspaper or use a brown paper bag).

Any way of reducing movement or the chance of stuff falling or moving around is nice.

I've also wrapped keyboards and other peripherals in plastic film before long trips.

More delicate stuff like monitors can be wrapped in towels, blankets or similar. Just make sure to remove the platforms/bases to make better use of the space.

That's what I've done when moving, but I'm sure someone else might have better/safer ideas.",0.2514508928571429,2

I would carry the PC, the monitors, (GPU ?), keyboard, and headset each drive on my lap (one per drive).

Is it alright to leave my GPU in or not? I don't have packaging available rn for most of the parts. I don't have any anti-static bags too...

I am scared for my curved monitor too ngl

Is it acceptable to carry my GPU without any packaging in my hand?

Would it be acceptable to carry my PC and after that my Monitors on my lap in the car or is it dangerous and risky? (PC mobo back facing my lap)

Any recommendations?

Would it be acceptable to carry my PC and after that my Monitors on my lap in the car or is it dangerous and risky? (PC mobo back facing my lap)

Any recommendations?

TLDR: ---

Thanks for reading!

4,2025-05-25,"Kendu - Strong Communities are inevitable The other day Bitcoin broke ATH multiple times, things look to be heating up very nicely in the market and I am as bullish as ever. Kendu has grinded for months during the slower markets and I am so proud of our efforts and everyone else who helped should be proud too.  
Over the next few months, I think we are gonna see a very green market and there is a lot of gains there for the taking.

I don’t know your personal investment philosophies and I don’t intend to change that at all, everyone is open to different levels of risk and everyone’s personal circumstances are different. Whether you invest 90% into Bitcoin, Ethereum or whatever and 10% into higher risk coins like memes… idk. But if for example you do put 10% of your investments into memes, it is highly advisable to choose memes that are backed by insanely strong communities, communities that are constantly grinding, day to day. As in the past we have coins like Pepe and Shiba Inu that performed outrageously reaching market caps of 10 billion and 44 billion respectively. There is more coins than those 2 though, that reached hundreds of millions or even a few billion in market cap, they all share a common trait, they were backed by insane communities.  
A strong community provides a coin with unlimited advertisement and generally makes a coin fun to be a part of. In memes, a strong community is **Everything**

**Examples of Kendu being a strong community**

* Only the 2nd coin to ever reach a free Certik Audit(you need 50k votes), the only other coin to manage this was Pepe
* Certik rates Kendu's community at a score of 98/100, whilst other coins with a ""strong"" community are in the 70s, even though they have a higher market cap and more holders, Kendu outperforms them. I have never seen Certik give a score over 98.
* Twitter engagement rivals the very strongest
* Reddit - check any memecoin subreddit and Kendu will be everywhere - our engagement is second to none
* So many IRL products including energy drinks, coffee, merch, video games, beer and more. These products are created by the average community member, there is no team
* Pickleball events in India
* Murals by community members

Although, I and many others(both individuals and industry leaders) see Kendu as the strongest community in the space right now, you may not choose Kendu. If you don’t for whatever reason, that is cool and I sincerely wish you the best of luck both in terms of material success and personal success. After all, money can’t buy happiness, but I can buy a 5.0 litre V8, so I guess that’s close enough : )  
But if you do choose, Kendu, get involved you will enjoy it far more than sitting in the shadows and welcome to the pack!

I don’t know your personal investment philosophies and I don’t intend to change that at all, everyone is open to different levels of risk and everyone’s personal circumstances are different. Whether you invest 90% into Bitcoin, Ethereum or whatever and 10% into higher risk coins like memes… idk. But if for example you do put 10% of your investments into memes, it is highly advisable to choose memes that are backed by insanely strong communities, communities that are constantly grinding, day to day. As in the past we have coins like Pepe and Shiba Inu that performed outrageously reaching market caps of 10 billion and 44 billion respectively. There is more coins than those 2 though, that reached hundreds of millions or even a few billion in market cap, they all share a common trait, they were backed by insane communities.

**Examples of Kendu being a strong community**

* Only the 2nd coin to ever reach a free Certik Audit(you need 50k votes), the only other coin to manage this was Pepe
* Certik rates Kendu's community at a score of 98/100, whilst other coins with a ""strong"" community are in the 70s, even though they have a higher market cap and more holders, Kendu outperforms them. I have never seen Certik give a score over 98.
* Twitter engagement rivals the very strongest
* Reddit - check any memecoin subreddit and Kendu will be everywhere - our engagement is second to none
* So many IRL products including energy drinks, coffee, merch, video games, beer and more. These products are created by the average community member, there is no team

Although, I and many others(both individuals and industry leaders) see Kendu as the strongest community in the space right now, you may not choose Kendu. If you don’t for whatever reason, that is cool and I sincerely wish you the best of luck both in terms of material success and personal success. After all, money can’t buy happiness, but I can buy a 5.0 litre V8, so I guess that’s close enough : )

Over the next few months, I think we are gonna see a very green market and there is a lot of gains there for the taking.

I don’t know your personal investment philosophies and I don’t intend to change that at all, everyone is open to different levels of risk and everyone’s personal circumstances are different. Whether you invest 90% into Bitcoin, Ethereum or whatever and 10% into higher risk coins like memes… idk. But if for example you do put 10% of your investments into memes, it is highly advisable to choose memes that are backed by insanely strong communities, communities that are constantly grinding, day to day. As in the past we have coins like Pepe and Shiba Inu that performed outrageously reaching market caps of 10 billion and 44 billion respectively. There is more coins than those 2 though, that reached hundreds of millions or even a few billion in market cap, they all share a common trait, they were backed by insane communities.  
A strong community provides a coin with unlimited advertisement and generally makes a coin fun to be a part of. In memes, a strong community is **Everything**

**Examples of Kendu being a strong community**

* Only the 2nd coin to ever reach a free Certik Audit(you need 50k votes), the only other coin to manage this was Pepe
* Certik rates Kendu's community at a score of 98/100, whilst other coins with a ""strong"" community are in the 70s, even though they have a higher market cap and more holders, Kendu outperforms them. I have never seen Certik give a score over 98.
* Twitter engagement rivals the very strongest
* Reddit - check any memecoin subreddit and Kendu will be everywhere - our engagement is second to none
* So many IRL products including energy drinks, coffee, merch, video games, beer and more. These products are created by the average community member, there is no team
* Pickleball events in India
* Murals by community members

Although, I and many others(both individuals and industry leaders) see Kendu as the strongest community in the space right now, you may not choose Kendu. If you don’t for whatever reason, that is cool and I sincerely wish you the best of luck both in terms of material success and personal success. After all, money can’t buy happiness, but I can buy a 5.0 litre V8, so I guess that’s close enough : )  
But if you do choose, Kendu, get involved you will enjoy it far more than sitting in the shadows and welcome to the pack!

But if for example you do put 10% of your investments into memes, it is highly advisable to choose memes that are backed by insanely strong communities, communities that are constantly grinding, day to day. As in the past we have coins like Pepe and Shiba Inu that performed outrageously reaching market caps of 10 billion and 44 billion respectively. There is more coins than those 2 though, that reached hundreds of millions or even a few billion in market cap, they all share a common trait, they were backed by insane communities.  
A strong community provides a coin with unlimited advertisement and generally makes a coin fun to be a part of. In memes, a strong community is **Everything**

**Examples of Kendu being a strong community**

* Only the 2nd coin to ever reach a free Certik Audit(you need 50k votes), the only other coin to manage this was Pepe
* Certik rates Kendu's community at a score of 98/100, whilst other coins with a ""strong"" community are in the 70s, even though they have a higher market cap and more holders, Kendu outperforms them. I have never seen Certik give a score over 98.
* Twitter engagement rivals the very strongest
* Reddit - check any memecoin subreddit and Kendu will be everywhere - our engagement is second to none
* So many IRL products including energy drinks, coffee, merch, video games, beer and more. These products are created by the average community member, there is no team
* Pickleball events in India
* Murals by community members

Although, I and many others(both individuals and industry leaders) see Kendu as the strongest community in the space right now, you may not choose Kendu. If you don’t for whatever reason, that is cool and I sincerely wish you the best of luck both in terms of material success and personal success. After all, money can’t buy happiness, but I can buy a 5.0 litre V8, so I guess that’s close enough : )  
But if you do choose, Kendu, get involved you will enjoy it far more than sitting in the shadows and welcome to the pack!

6,2025-05-25,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday (LATE) Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

6 more hours of drive time and business trip #2 in 2 days! I just got in off the road, and again, Tulsa roads SUCK! Either way, I missed y'all! Momentum indicators show a strategic pullback; with what appears to be institutional investors testing the market across multiple time frames, leading to some profit-taking. ‘Reaccumulation’ is holding on to Neutral ground. Trend Indicators show the price WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, revealing signs of recovery and price stabilization, while Bollinger Bands are sharply contracted, signaling imminent breakout pressure. ADX values reveal recovering Average Trend strength, holding the price just BELOW the Supertrend and the Long term EMAs. With the price AT the 12-Day EMA, this shows a Consolidation zone where the price will look to strengthen ABOVE the Long term EMAs to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators are supporting the Bollinger Bands breakout signal, with Volatility falling to the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements are holding WITHIN the Volatility Bands, signaling solid Support/Resistance channels.

Volume Indicators highlight a slight weakness in participation, but Long term reveals strategic ‘Reaccumulation’ attempts from ‘Smart Money’. Looking at our money flow signals recovery from Oversold conditions, with a closer look revealing that profit-taking moved just a little bit more money out of the market than ‘Smart Money’ could move in. Sentiment Indicators show increasing levels of accumulation off the bounce, meaning that this Support level is holding and has become a healthy point for Buyers to absorb the supply from the ‘Sell Wall’. This profit-taking only managed to cultivate a very Weak Short term negative Trend cycle, while overall ‘Smart Money’ continues to strengthen the Long term positive Trend cycle. News articles held a Long term Bullish narrative driven by reports of record token burns, technical breakout projections, and strategic ecosystem updates. The articles continue with the Utility narrative while there were Short term highlights of technical signals showing increasing Volatility, but overall these insights help ease FUD/FOMO while revealing increasing levels of institutional support and awareness.

This ‘Accumulation/Reaccumulation’ phase shows no signs of breakdown, but the temporary Consolidations are quite disruptive and the resilient order flow from ‘Smart Money’ participation seems to be extending the base of supply absorption through the demand zone. These are increasingly confident bounces showing the formation of higher LOWS, validating the Uptrend structure. What we're waiting for now is to see a breakout ABOVE the Neutral zone with increasing Volume that will help us identify the transition to ‘Markup’.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is WITHIN the Short term Neutral zone. At MAX, the price will capture the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001500. If we can break ABOVE the Neutral zones, our 1st Target MAX will be to test the ‘Wall of Resistance’ up to around the midsection, just ABOVE the 1st-level Resistance pivot point, where I see this convergence of the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastics reaching 70% at $0.00001600. That will act as a stall zone. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‘Wall of Support’ down to the 50% retracement of the 13‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001390.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

The petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.

**Introduction** 

Hello, all! I've done one of these before for my husband and was suggested a GSD. He got a GSD and she's been his PERFECT dog, so thank you! Now I'm looking for me. I have my dream dog now, but he's going on 8 and I'm starting to think ahead to when he's no longer with me (it breaks my heart 💔). 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

* No. I've had dogs all my life. Currently our household has four:
 - a cattledog/pitbull/gsd mix who has a ton of health issues and will need to be put down probably at the end of this summer 😭
- my daughter's corgi/chihuahua/poodle/shiba inu (I do the training, daughter is learning to train her too)
- my husband's GSD (I do most of the training for her, he helps when he's home)
- my baby and heart dog, a Collie/Husky/GSD/Cattledog/American Eskimo/Rottie/Boxer/some-supermutt-for-good-measure (😆). He's my perfect boy. If I could recreate him I would. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)? 

* No...well, maybe? For the perfect dog I'll rescue, but I do lean towards a breeder simply because we've had such bad luck health wise with our rescues (i.e. the cattledog/pit) and we're pretty emotionally exhausted on that front. And, while it worked out beautifully with Wylie, I'm not big on playing the genetics lottery with temperament. I never intended to own something so ""bull-headed"" as a cattledog pitbull or ""free-spirited"" as a corgi/chi 😆😆😆 silly and loveable as they both are!

3)	Describe your ideal dog. 

* Fairly biddable but thinks for themselves. Something more sensitive than a GSD. I love ours to death but she's a bit... uh... daft, LOL! She has so much heart and desire to please but I need a little more intelligence and sensitivity and less ""blunt instrument."" The way I like to describe it... she is am EXCELLENT dog, but Wylie (my collie/husky/etc) and I are a team, more equals than master and dog. It feels like he can read my mind and see what I'm trying to do, rather than waiting for me to tell him how to think. I like a dog who is aware of their body/feet and not clumsy.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? 

* I like herding dogs, but I'm not set on it. Malinois interest me, but I'm not sure if it's a match. I haven't spent enough time with one to really get a feel for them. I like the look of the beauceron and Doberman. I also love rough/smooth collies. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 

* Basic obedience and some trick training. Wylie loves to work. He also is a Frisbee dog, and I LOVE that about him. His athleticism and speed are so awesome to me. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 

* I'd love this. I've done agility with Wylie and barnhunt with Rain (Corgi/Chihuahua). We have dock diving nearby, and we're keen on doing search and rescue/scentwork with Whimsy (GSD). Basically I'll try anything 😀 

**Care Commitments** 

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

* As much as it takes. Dogs are my passion! We are a dog family and live accordingly, lol!

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

 * No going into a dog park, though I frequently take my dogs around the outside of it to work on ""leave it."" We live in a desert, so there are definitely some days we will have to spend indoors midday. We do walks/outings in the mornings and evenings. We do a lot of outdoor adventuring/camping in cooler climates and like to have trail/biking buddies. We have access to a huge, enclosed field for Frisbee which is one of our favorite dog pastimes. We love obedience and trick training.

 9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? 

* Not a fan of the upkeep on curly coats. I don't mind (and actually rather enjoy) grooming longer coats. I don't mind shorter coats either. We do pay for professional grooming occasionally (usually when everyone's blowing their coats for the summer). 

 **Personal Preferences** 

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

 * Any, though bigger is better so our clumsy GSD doesn't step on anyone (always having to watch the corgi/chi with her)

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

 * not a huge fan of excess slobber. Lots of incessant barking is a no-go, but talking and alerting is fine. we're fairly confident in training ""quiet.""

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

 * Decently important. I don't mind keeping the dogs on leads (and wish more people would too) but I do want to have a good recall trained in. I also like a dog who wants to stay close.  

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

 13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

 * probably more snuggly, though I'm not offended by either.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

 * Eager to please but able to think for themselves. Someone who will be my ride or die once I earn their respect. Wylie sometimes will go through phases of testing the boundaries, but falls back in when he realizes I'm still firm on them. It amuses me!

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

 * Alert, and then quiet when I notice. Wylie is very quiet once he realizes I'm aware. He will ""flank"" a stranger, give them a good sniff, then walk away when he doesn't see a threat. If I tell him ""go to bed"" he will go lay down until I release him, even with lots of excitement at the front door.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? 

* I don't mind working on some basics (like resource guarding/socialization) but we cannot keep a dog who is consistently aggressive with other dogs since we are a multi-dog household. 

 17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

 * No excess yapping (so long as their tired out. Our current dogs will get vocal when they haven't been walked, and that's fine). I'm not a fan of dogs who are super bossy with other dogs, though I'm willing to work on this with the right one. I prefer a dog who is careful about foot placement and isn't overly clumsy.

 **Lifestyle**

 18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

 * I'm a stay at home mom, so not often. Maybe 1-3 hours during the week. My youngest daughter is medically fragile and occasionally we have to travel for her specialists, so a day or two gone every few months. We make sure someone is here to let the dogs out during that time, but they certainly don't get the exercise they're used to on those days. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

 * No yapping. Nothing overly excitable/pees when excited. Everyone is willing to help out/play/reinforce training with the dogs, but it'll be primarily my dog.

 20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? 

* Multi-dog household. We intend to have chickens, but will keep them separate from the dogs.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

 * Yes, we have two young children who often have friends over. We can keep the dogs separated in the kennel but would prefer to be able to have them around.

 22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? 

* We own our home.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

 * New Mexico, USA. No breed restrictions where we are. 

 24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

* Average summer is high 80s-90s, though it often pops up over 100. We intend to camp a lot during the hotter months, up in the cooler mountains. Winters are usually 30s-40s.  

 **Additional Information and Questions** 

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. 

* We have people over a lot. I can keep the dog separate if need be but it would be nice to have them with us. Not a deal breaker if not.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.",0.19752293874707666,1,11,"maybe a show line bc ? i don’t normally suggest them but if you do sports they are a nice option. a wl gsd will be more smart than your current too but i know what you mean, i’ll pick mal over gsd anyday 😂 maybe a rough collie too ? they’re good family dogs but can do sporty things ",0.21897321428571426,4

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 

* Basic obedience and some trick training. Wylie loves to work. He also is a Frisbee dog, and I LOVE that about him. His athleticism and speed are so awesome to me. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 

* I'd love this. I've done agility with Wylie and barnhunt with Rain (Corgi/Chihuahua). We have dock diving nearby, and we're keen on doing search and rescue/scentwork with Whimsy (GSD). Basically I'll try anything 😀 

**Care Commitments** 

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

* As much as it takes. Dogs are my passion! We are a dog family and live accordingly, lol!

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

 * No going into a dog park, though I frequently take my dogs around the outside of it to work on ""leave it."" We live in a desert, so there are definitely some days we will have to spend indoors midday. We do walks/outings in the mornings and evenings. We do a lot of outdoor adventuring/camping in cooler climates and like to have trail/biking buddies. We have access to a huge, enclosed field for Frisbee which is one of our favorite dog pastimes. We love obedience and trick training.

 9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? 

* Not a fan of the upkeep on curly coats. I don't mind (and actually rather enjoy) grooming longer coats. I don't mind shorter coats either. We do pay for professional grooming occasionally (usually when everyone's blowing their coats for the summer). 

 **Personal Preferences** 

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

 * Any, though bigger is better so our clumsy GSD doesn't step on anyone (always having to watch the corgi/chi with her)

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

 * not a huge fan of excess slobber. Lots of incessant barking is a no-go, but talking and alerting is fine. we're fairly confident in training ""quiet.""

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

 * Decently important. I don't mind keeping the dogs on leads (and wish more people would too) but I do want to have a good recall trained in. I also like a dog who wants to stay close.  

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

 13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

 * probably more snuggly, though I'm not offended by either.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

 * Eager to please but able to think for themselves. Someone who will be my ride or die once I earn their respect. Wylie sometimes will go through phases of testing the boundaries, but falls back in when he realizes I'm still firm on them. It amuses me!

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

 * Alert, and then quiet when I notice. Wylie is very quiet once he realizes I'm aware. He will ""flank"" a stranger, give them a good sniff, then walk away when he doesn't see a threat. If I tell him ""go to bed"" he will go lay down until I release him, even with lots of excitement at the front door.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? 

* I don't mind working on some basics (like resource guarding/socialization) but we cannot keep a dog who is consistently aggressive with other dogs since we are a multi-dog household. 

 17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

 * No excess yapping (so long as their tired out. Our current dogs will get vocal when they haven't been walked, and that's fine). I'm not a fan of dogs who are super bossy with other dogs, though I'm willing to work on this with the right one. I prefer a dog who is careful about foot placement and isn't overly clumsy.

 **Lifestyle**

 18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

 * I'm a stay at home mom, so not often. Maybe 1-3 hours during the week. My youngest daughter is medically fragile and occasionally we have to travel for her specialists, so a day or two gone every few months. We make sure someone is here to let the dogs out during that time, but they certainly don't get the exercise they're used to on those days. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

 * No yapping. Nothing overly excitable/pees when excited. Everyone is willing to help out/play/reinforce training with the dogs, but it'll be primarily my dog.

 20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? 

* Multi-dog household. We intend to have chickens, but will keep them separate from the dogs.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

 * Yes, we have two young children who often have friends over. We can keep the dogs separated in the kennel but would prefer to be able to have them around.

 22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? 

* We own our home.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

 * New Mexico, USA. No breed restrictions where we are. 

 24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

* Average summer is high 80s-90s, though it often pops up over 100. We intend to camp a lot during the hotter months, up in the cooler mountains. Winters are usually 30s-40s.  

 **Additional Information and Questions** 

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. 

* We have people over a lot. I can keep the dog separate if need be but it would be nice to have them with us. Not a deal breaker if not.

**Introduction** 

Hello, all! I've done one of these before for my husband and was suggested a GSD. He got a GSD and she's been his PERFECT dog, so thank you! Now I'm looking for me. I have my dream dog now, but he's going on 8 and I'm starting to think ahead to when he's no longer with me (it breaks my heart 💔). 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

* No. I've had dogs all my life. Currently our household has four:
 - a cattledog/pitbull/gsd mix who has a ton of health issues and will need to be put down probably at the end of this summer 😭
- my daughter's corgi/chihuahua/poodle/shiba inu (I do the training, daughter is learning to train her too)
- my husband's GSD (I do most of the training for her, he helps when he's home)
- my baby and heart dog, a Collie/Husky/GSD/Cattledog/American Eskimo/Rottie/Boxer/some-supermutt-for-good-measure (😆). He's my perfect boy. If I could recreate him I would. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)? 

* No...well, maybe? For the perfect dog I'll rescue, but I do lean towards a breeder simply because we've had such bad luck health wise with our rescues (i.e. the cattledog/pit) and we're pretty emotionally exhausted on that front. And, while it worked out beautifully with Wylie, I'm not big on playing the genetics lottery with temperament. I never intended to own something so ""bull-headed"" as a cattledog pitbull or ""free-spirited"" as a corgi/chi 😆😆😆 silly and loveable as they both are!

3)	Describe your ideal dog. 

* Fairly biddable but thinks for themselves. Something more sensitive than a GSD. I love ours to death but she's a bit... uh... daft, LOL! She has so much heart and desire to please but I need a little more intelligence and sensitivity and less ""blunt instrument."" The way I like to describe it... she is am EXCELLENT dog, but Wylie (my collie/husky/etc) and I are a team, more equals than master and dog. It feels like he can read my mind and see what I'm trying to do, rather than waiting for me to tell him how to think. I like a dog who is aware of their body/feet and not clumsy.

 * Any, though bigger is better so our clumsy GSD doesn't step on anyone (always having to watch the corgi/chi with her)

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

 * not a huge fan of excess slobber. Lots of incessant barking is a no-go, but talking and alerting is fine. we're fairly confident in training ""quiet.""

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

 * Decently important. I don't mind keeping the dogs on leads (and wish more people would too) but I do want to have a good recall trained in. I also like a dog who wants to stay close.  

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

 13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

 * probably more snuggly, though I'm not offended by either.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

 * Eager to please but able to think for themselves. Someone who will be my ride or die once I earn their respect. Wylie sometimes will go through phases of testing the boundaries, but falls back in when he realizes I'm still firm on them. It amuses me!

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

 * Alert, and then quiet when I notice. Wylie is very quiet once he realizes I'm aware. He will ""flank"" a stranger, give them a good sniff, then walk away when he doesn't see a threat. If I tell him ""go to bed"" he will go lay down until I release him, even with lots of excitement at the front door.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? 

* I don't mind working on some basics (like resource guarding/socialization) but we cannot keep a dog who is consistently aggressive with other dogs since we are a multi-dog household. 

 17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

 * No excess yapping (so long as their tired out. Our current dogs will get vocal when they haven't been walked, and that's fine). I'm not a fan of dogs who are super bossy with other dogs, though I'm willing to work on this with the right one. I prefer a dog who is careful about foot placement and isn't overly clumsy.

 **Lifestyle**

 18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

 * I'm a stay at home mom, so not often. Maybe 1-3 hours during the week. My youngest daughter is medically fragile and occasionally we have to travel for her specialists, so a day or two gone every few months. We make sure someone is here to let the dogs out during that time, but they certainly don't get the exercise they're used to on those days. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

 * No yapping. Nothing overly excitable/pees when excited. Everyone is willing to help out/play/reinforce training with the dogs, but it'll be primarily my dog.

 20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? 

* Multi-dog household. We intend to have chickens, but will keep them separate from the dogs.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

 * Yes, we have two young children who often have friends over. We can keep the dogs separated in the kennel but would prefer to be able to have them around.

 22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? 

* We own our home.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

 * New Mexico, USA. No breed restrictions where we are. 

 24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

* Average summer is high 80s-90s, though it often pops up over 100. We intend to camp a lot during the hotter months, up in the cooler mountains. Winters are usually 30s-40s.  

 **Additional Information and Questions** 

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant. 

* We have people over a lot. I can keep the dog separate if need be but it would be nice to have them with us. Not a deal breaker if not.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.",0.19752293874707666,1,11,"💯 temperament can be tricky in this breed. Guarding behavior is part of the written standard, but some breeders have given a pass to questionable temperament using that as a reason.",-0.25,1

**Introduction** 

Hello, all! I've done one of these before for my husband and was suggested a GSD. He got a GSD and she's been his PERFECT dog, so thank you! Now I'm looking for me. I have my dream dog now, but he's going on 8 and I'm starting to think ahead to when he's no longer with me (it breaks my heart 💔). 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? 

* No. I've had dogs all my life. Currently our household has four:
 - a cattledog/pitbull/gsd mix who has a ton of health issues and will need to be put down probably at the end of this summer 😭
- my daughter's corgi/chihuahua/poodle/shiba inu (I do the training, daughter is learning to train her too)
- my husband's GSD (I do most of the training for her, he helps when he's home)
- my baby and heart dog, a Collie/Husky/GSD/Cattledog/American Eskimo/Rottie/Boxer/some-supermutt-for-good-measure (😆). He's my perfect boy. If I could recreate him I would. 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)? 

* No...well, maybe? For the perfect dog I'll rescue, but I do lean towards a breeder simply because we've had such bad luck health wise with our rescues (i.e. the cattledog/pit) and we're pretty emotionally exhausted on that front. And, while it worked out beautifully with Wylie, I'm not big on playing the genetics lottery with temperament. I never intended to own something so ""bull-headed"" as a cattledog pitbull or ""free-spirited"" as a corgi/chi 😆😆😆 silly and loveable as they both are!

3)	Describe your ideal dog. 

* Fairly biddable but thinks for themselves. Something more sensitive than a GSD. I love ours to death but she's a bit... uh... daft, LOL! She has so much heart and desire to please but I need a little more intelligence and sensitivity and less ""blunt instrument."" The way I like to describe it... she is am EXCELLENT dog, but Wylie (my collie/husky/etc) and I are a team, more equals than master and dog. It feels like he can read my mind and see what I'm trying to do, rather than waiting for me to tell him how to think. I like a dog who is aware of their body/feet and not clumsy.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? 

* I like herding dogs, but I'm not set on it. Malinois interest me, but I'm not sure if it's a match. I haven't spent enough time with one to really get a feel for them. I like the look of the beauceron and Doberman. I also love rough/smooth collies. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? 

* Basic obedience and some trick training. Wylie loves to work. He also is a Frisbee dog, and I LOVE that about him. His athleticism and speed are so awesome to me. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport? 

* I'd love this. I've done agility with Wylie and barnhunt with Rain (Corgi/Chihuahua). We have dock diving nearby, and we're keen on doing search and rescue/scentwork with Whimsy (GSD). Basically I'll try anything 😀 

**Care Commitments** 

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

* As much as it takes. Dogs are my passion! We are a dog family and live accordingly, lol!

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

 * No going into a dog park, though I frequently take my dogs around the outside of it to work on ""leave it."" We live in a desert, so there are definitely some days we will have to spend indoors midday. We do walks/outings in the mornings and evenings. We do a lot of outdoor adventuring/camping in cooler climates and like to have trail/biking buddies. We have access to a huge, enclosed field for Frisbee which is one of our favorite dog pastimes. We love obedience and trick training.

 9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? 

* Not a fan of the upkeep on curly coats. I don't mind (and actually rather enjoy) grooming longer coats. I don't mind shorter coats either. We do pay for professional grooming occasionally (usually when everyone's blowing their coats for the summer).
