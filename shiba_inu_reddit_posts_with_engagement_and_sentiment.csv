2025-04-24,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We pulled back as expected to a Short Consolidation phase, which opened up a Buy opportunity for investors in the dip. Momentum Indicators signal that, despite some profit-taking and Buyers entering a wait-and-see phase, the dip allowed Buyers to maintain a Weak level of control in comparison to the Sellers’ participation. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, which is a Bullish signal, and when we combine this with the contraction of the Bollinger Bands, we get an early indication of breakout pressure building following a Bullish Consolidation. ADX values show Average Trend strength while the price trades ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, verifying active levels of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction as Volatility remains in the Neutral of our norms range. Price stability holding WITHIN the Volatility Bands, along with increasing averages, supports Bullish Consolidation and the potential for breakout pressure.

Volume Indicators reveal increased Short term participation, which means that dip Buying is occurring despite the LOW level of activity. However, overall, Sellers and profit-taking moved more money out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong distribution from profit-taking Sellers, which in the Short term has overtaken the rate of accumulation from Buyers, creating a new emerging negative Trend cycle. Despite this Consolidation, the Buyers were able to sustain the Long term positive Trend cycle, as seen by the increasingly positive PVT value. News articles remain Bullish, with reports of token burns, breakout signals, and optimistic price targets that continue to strengthen the positive narrative and highlight the evolution from MEME to Utility. There are articles highlighting headwinds such as ‘Death Cross’ warnings and a major correction, but overall these narratives are geared toward continuing to mitigate FUD/FOMO through fact-based insights, which only reinforce investor confidence.

I see the market at a crossroads where, on one hand, we have some clear Bullish signals of ‘Price Action’, yet on the other hand, underperforming headwinds are developing due to Buyers losing Momentum as they gauge the market for clear direction. I think this crossroads creates an opportunity for Buy Volume to increase and revive Momentum, but we need to be aware of the Consolidation phases, as the market will likely continue running sideways until everyone gets an idea of what direction to go instead of just providing exit liquidity for a Sell Wall.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting AT the Short term Neutral major pivot point, which is basically aligned with the Long term Neutral major pivot point, at $0.00001350. Given the tightness of this range, prices could become quite volatile and move in either direction. At MAX, the price will attempt to reach the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001410. At LOWEST, the price is going to reach down WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ to the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. Because this market could go in either direction, I will extend the range to a TOP breakout beyond MAX to be the 50% retracement of the 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001520. The BOTTOM, past the LOWEST breakdown, would be the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-24,"Split nail help! Hi friends! Quick background, I recently got a 7 year old Shiba Inu in an emergency situation from a family friend. She is the absolute sweetest baby, and although I wasn’t planning on getting a dog any time soon (7 months pregnant and had to quit job due to blood pressure) I adore her. When I got her, she was a little neglected- not abused per se, but there were situations with previous owners that limited care. I’ve spent the past couple months focusing on getting some fat on her/fixing her yeast infection on her skin, and I recently noticed a crack (?) in one of her nails. When I got her, her nails with INSANELY long, and very sensitive to being cut or drilled. I’ve been drilling them bit by bit each week to try and get her used to it at home, but I think I was too confident and the length resulted in the current problem. 

Does anyone have any advice on what to do that doesn’t involve a vet unless necessary? If I need to, I’ll obviously take her, regardless of cost, but she doesn’t seem to be in pain or be bothered by the nail. The split is on the very outer part of her nail, and seems to stop right before the quick. ",0.06976757369614513,1,1
2025-04-24,"Would you get your dog back or leave things alone? Cross-posted

This may be a little long, so please bare with me.  But the basic question is... Should I go and get my dog back, or should I just leave things the way they are?

And please please be gentle.  This situation is hard and I'm just looking for some advice and guidance.

Four years ago, I left my abusive husband.  I moved into a rental townhome with my four teens/preteens. 

I was not able to take my pets.  

A few months later, my ex husband threatened to throw our cat out of the car, and I was able to rescue him and hide him in my townhome.

He then started to complain about our dog, and there was no way I could take her, so I immediately began looking for a home.  I also reached out to a Shiba Inu rescue and within two days, I had several options for rehoming her.

I let him know right away... That was a Sunday.

On Monday, he told me she was gone.

I was able to find out that he sold her to our Mennonite neighbor, who was moving to IL, that same day.  So she was gone and there was nothing we could do.

I felt awful and guilty.  She went from living an indoor life, dog beds, four kids who loved her and spoiled her, to an outdoors only existence, to be used for breeding puppies (I hadn't had a chance to spay her).

I have never forgotten her and have always felt awful about what happened to her.  The is never even got to say goodbye.  

Fast forward three and a half years.

I'm now very happily remarried and my husband and I just bought a new home together.  We have a 1.5 yr old golden retriever and plenty of space.

I called my Mennonite friends who have my older dog and they are more than willing to give her back.  

We're planning to go get her next weekend.  

Here's my question though.  Is this potentially more harmful to her than just letting her be, and live out her days?  They are not breeding her (she's 7, so too old).  She will be living indoors only with us.

It will be just as much of a jarring change as when she was first sold.

I have no idea what kind of dog we're getting back.  How will she be with our other dog?  

Also... We have two cats and she has always had a very high prey drive towards cats.

I feel like leaving her is wrong.  She deserves to live out her life in comfort.  But I fear that we may be doing more harm than good by bringing her home.

So... What would you do?!

2025-04-24,"Top 10 most popular cryptocurrencies by Google queries and their prospects for 2025–2030 In recent years, cryptocurrencies have taken on an important place in global financial systems, and their popularity is only growing. In 2023, several cryptocurrencies became leaders in Google search queries, reflecting the interest and attention they attract from both institutional and retail investors. In this article, we will look at the most popular cryptocurrencies of 2023, including Bitcoin (BTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Cosmos (ATOM), Polygon (MATIC), Dogecoin (DOGE), EOS (EOS), Cardano (ADA), BNB (BNB), and, of course, Qwadrox (QWRX). We will also attempt to forecast their growth and assess their prospects for the next five years.

# 1. Bitcoin (BTC)



**Bitcoin is rightly considered the first and most popular cryptocurrency. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has become a symbol of the decentralized financial system. In 2023, Bitcoin remains the leader in market capitalization and the number of Google queries. It is a cryptocurrency that currently appears stable and reliable, despite market volatility.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Global acceptance: Bitcoin continues to be adopted at the country and large corporation levels. It is used as a store of value (digital gold) and as a means of savings in countries with unstable currencies.**
* **Limited supply: Bitcoin has a strict limit of 21 million coins, creating scarcity and supporting its value.**
* **Institutions and ETFs: The ongoing integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system through futures and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) significantly increases its liquidity and stability.**

# 5-year forecast:

Bitcoin is likely to continue strengthening its position as the main cryptocurrency, and its price could reach $150,000–$200,000 by 2028, given the ongoing interest from institutional investors and global recognition.

# 2. Shiba Inu (SHIB)



**Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrency that gained popularity due to its meme nature. Although it was created as a joke, Shiba Inu quickly captured the market and attracted the attention of traders and investors looking for short-term profit.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Community strength: A large and active community has formed around Shiba Inu, actively promoting the token and supporting its price.**
* **New projects: Shiba Inu is gradually evolving, expanding its ecosystem, including the creation of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and its own metaverse (Shiba Inu Metaverse).**

# 5-year forecast:

Shiba Inu will continue to attract attention from speculators, and in the short term, there are likely to be sharp price fluctuations. However, long-term growth depends on real applications in DeFi and other areas, and the price could range between $0.00001 and $0.0001.

# 3. Ethereum (ETH)



**Ethereum is a platform for creating decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, and one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. Ethereum continues to evolve and improve, and its influence on the blockchain technology market is undeniable.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Transition to Ethereum 2.0: The shift from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) will significantly reduce energy consumption and increase transaction speeds.**
* **Growth in DeFi and NFT usage: Ethereum is the primary blockchain for many DeFi applications and the NFT market, contributing to its steady growth.**

# 5-year forecast:

Ethereum has strong prospects for the next five years as its technology becomes increasingly scalable and efficient. The projected price by 2028 is between $10,000 and $15,000.

# 4. XRP



**XRP is a cryptocurrency used for fast and cheap interbank money transfers. It was developed by Ripple Labs and is actively used by major financial institutions.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Partnerships with major banks: XRP continues to gain popularity among financial organizations looking to reduce costs on international transfers.**
* **Regulatory clarity: After long legal proceedings with the SEC, XRP has a chance to gain a clearer legal basis, which will increase trust in the currency.**

# 5-year forecast:

XRP could show significant growth if all legal issues are resolved and partnerships with banks are expanded. The price could range from $5 to $10 in the next five years.

# 5. Cosmos (ATOM)



**Cosmos provides a solution for inter-blockchain communication, allowing different blockchains to exchange data and assets. This makes Cosmos an important player in the market.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Inter-blockchain communication: Cosmos addresses the problem of blockchain isolation, making it a platform of the future.**
* **Attracting developers: The project actively works with developers, fostering the creation of new and innovative decentralized applications.**

# 5-year forecast:

Cosmos could become an important part of the blockchain ecosystem, especially if technologies for interaction between different blockchains start to dominate the market. The expected price by 2028 is $50–100.

# 6. Polygon (MATIC)



**Polygon is a second-layer solution for Ethereum that significantly improves scalability and reduces transaction costs.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Integration with Ethereum**: Polygon actively collaborates with Ethereum, providing scalability for its applications and expanding the ecosystem. 
* **Popularity of DeFi and NFT: Polygon is used by many DeFi and NFT projects, increasing its significance in the market.**

# 5-year forecast:

Polygon is likely to continue evolving within the Ethereum ecosystem and become one of the leaders among second-layer solutions. The projected price by 2028 is $5.

# 7. Dogecoin (DOGE)



**Dogecoin is a meme coin that became popular due to its humorous nature and the support of well-known personalities like Elon Musk.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Community strength and celebrity support**: Dogecoin continues to have enormous support from its community and well-known personalities such as Elon Musk. **Continuous improvement: Despite its meme nature, Dogecoin is actively developing and could become a stable cryptocurrency in the future.**

# 5-year forecast:

Dogecoin will continue to be volatile, but if it remains popular, its price could rise to $1–2.

# 8. EOS



**EOS offers a high-speed platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. It aims to address scalability issues faced by other blockchains.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **High throughput**: EOS offers significant performance, making it attractive to developers. 
* **Support for large projects: EOS is actively used by large companies and projects, increasing its value.**

# 5-year forecast:

EOS will continue to evolve and improve, offering new opportunities for dApps. The projected price by 2028 is $5.  


# 9. Cardano (ADA)



**Cardano is a blockchain platform focused on security and scalability, using a scientific approach to develop its technologies.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Research-based approach**: Cardano employs research and testing methodologies, attracting developers and investors. 
* **Potential for global application: Cardano is actively developing partnerships with governments and large organizations, which could lead to widespread adoption.**

# 5-year forecast:

Cardano will continue to develop innovative solutions for scalability and security. The projected price by 2028 is $10–$15.

# 10. BNB



**BNB is a token used in the Binance ecosystem, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Usage in Binance**: BNB is actively used to pay fees on the exchange, stimulating demand for this token. 
* **Development of Binance Chain: Binance continues to develop its own blockchain network, increasing the significance of BNB.**



# 5-year forecast:

The price of BNB could reach $1,500–$1,800 in the next 5 years due to increased demand for its use within the Binance ecosystem.

# 11. Qwadrox (QWRX)



**Qwadrox (QWRX) is a relatively new cryptocurrency that is actively attracting investor attention. The project focuses on creating solutions for scaling and enhancing the security of blockchain systems, combined with philanthropy.**

# Reasons for growth:

* **Innovative technology**: Qwadrox develops unique solutions for blockchain ecosystems, making it promising. 
* **Partnerships with major companies: QWRX actively collaborates with industry leaders to implement its solutions in real life.**

# 5-year forecast:

Qwadrox could take strong positions in the blockchain market. If the project continues to develop its technology and attract new partners, its price could reach $1 and above.",0.1634189213564214,0,12

2025-04-24,"The Cult Awakens: The Most Underrated Crypto Play Before the Next Bull Run The Cult Awakens: The Most Underrated Crypto Play Before the Next Bull Run

In a sea of noise, one project has quietly been building something revolutionary.

Cult DAO, known for funding projects that fight centralization and empower the people, is preparing to unleash its most ambitious project yet:

Modulus zkEVM — A Privacy-First, Ethereum-Compatible Layer 2

This isn’t just another Layer 2. Modulus is different:

zkEVM-based for fast, low-cost transactions

Privacy-optional, giving users control over what stays on-chain

Fully community-owned, built by a decentralized collective—not VCs


And here's the game-changer:

Modulus doesn’t use ETH for gas—it uses $CULT.

Yes, every transaction on the Modulus chain will require $CULT.
That means more adoption = more demand = more $CULT burned.


---

Why This Matters

In 2021, Shiba Inu hit a $40B market cap—with zero utility.
Modulus brings real infrastructure to crypto:

True decentralization

Real use-case for $CULT

On-chain privacy and EVM compatibility

No insiders, no billion-dollar presale


This isn’t hype—it’s substance waiting to be noticed.


---

The Early Opportunity

Cult DAO and $CULT are still under the radar. At a micro-cap valuation, $CULT is one of the most asymmetric opportunities in crypto.

If Modulus catches on:

dApps will deploy

Transactions will soar

$CULT becomes the backbone of the chain


And early holders stand to benefit the most.


---

The Call to Action

The question isn’t “Will this go 1000x?”
It’s “Do I want to be the one who said ‘I bought before Modulus launched?’”

The cult is rising. And this time, it’s building the chain.

2025-04-23,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Buyers are growing more and more Bullish and beginning to chip away at the Sell Wall, but profit-taking seems to be cooling the market as the counteracting pressure is leading to Consolidation. Momentum Indicators signal that Buyers are increasing their positions over multiple time frames without reaching Overbought. Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, but given the attraction of the price to that HIGH Band and the continued expansion of the Bollinger Bands, this confirms a Bullish Consolidation phase. ADX values reveal Strong Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, confirming resilient levels of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion with Volatility rising even further into the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements remain well ABOVE the Volatility Bands, supporting an outlook of Bullish Consolidation.

Volume Indicators signal reduced participation, yet the few that are buying are counteracting a massive Sell Wall and continue to move more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to highlight Strong levels of accumulation greater than the profit-taking distribution, which has flipped the Long term negative Trend cycle and established a positive Trend cycle. News articles continue the positive narrative by covering ecosystem milestones, burn events, and breakout signals that seem to further the shifting from MEME to Utility. At the same time, there are cautions regarding technical Resistances and ecosystem warnings that work to temper FUD/FOMO by using fact-based analysis.

We are continuing to run Bullish and Buyers are showing greater levels of control while the Sentiment remains very positive. Despite some of the Volume headwinds, if you have been following along with my process, Sentiment accounts for 49.84% of price movement and Volume only accounts for 14.33%. I anticipate that the market will run through a Consolidation phase and may pull back a little, but as we pick up new Buy Volume, this will sustain the Uptrend cycle and prevent a Strong pullback.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is in a Neutral zone, pressed between the Long and Short term Neutral major pivot points, in a range from $0.00001360 down to $0.00001290. At MAX, the price will pick up some Volume and sustain positive Sentiment, reaching up to the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001420. Breaking ABOVE this level, our next target would be the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001540. At LOWEST, the price will follow the 4-Week retracement levels and reach down WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’ to the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. If we fall BELOW this level, the depth of pullback would be the BOTTOM of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001150.

2025-04-23,"Possible seizures? Canine pains that come and go. My boyfriends 10 year old Shiba Inu seemed to hurt himself 4 days ago, coming up the stairs to the outside deck. Immediately before he was running around, then he ran up the 4 small stairs and began whimpering once he reached the top of the stairs, and cried at the door until we let him in.

Since then, he has had random bouts of whimpering and limping on his front left leg. Twice he has even launched into a full on fit, screaming like hes being stabbed for about 3 minutes before he settles down, but otherwise he has been completely fine. Putting weight on both legs equally, stretching, even trotting to the backdoor, happy as can be.

We've searched his foot and leg and have found no apparent injuries. Unfortunately he is a huge baby when it comes to being manhandled so he cries and freaks out no matter which leg we handle, so we can't tell if the pain is coming from his shoulder, his wrist, etc.

But the random bouts of shrieking have me wondering if it could be a muscle spasm or seizure?  Once he's over them, he limps his way to his bed and then is okay a while later. However, he also hates high pitched noises, like fire alarm beeps and phone notifications, so these seem to cause him to tense up and he whimpers quickly, then stops.

Does this sound like a seizure to anyone?",0.11070048309178744,1,1
2025-04-23,Is Shiba Inu good dog for first time dog owners Okay before I get attacked I want to state I’ve had plenty of experience with all types of dogs. My mom showed German shepherds her whole life and trained them. I’ve trained our current German shepherd too with her guidance to do agility. I’ve just heard they are a handful and very intelligent. Which makes me think they might be a bit trickier than the German shepherds I’m used to.

2025-04-23,"Sims Lookbook 8: Yakuza Young Master With A Heart Of Gold For the grand finale to my Cheer Squad x Bad Boy Band showcase let me introduce the young man who started it all.

This is Kenzo Goeman. 

Currently residenting in Evergreen He undoubtedly looks the scariest of the boys but is very much the friendliest. Outgoing and Huge Lovebug to his core, the big brother of the group in all ways.

His style is just as punk with a little more class as he comes from money, unlike his sworn brothers. He has a few Yakuza-like staples in his wardrobe but mostly sticks to a practical punk style out of personal tasks and function. The biggest standout is his blood-red dyed hair with an undercut, his natural hair being an extremely dark brown somewhere between the color of his younger half-siblings' hair. 

As to why there are half-siblings, well……the simple fact is Kenzo’s father, Kyoya, is a piece of shit. 

Marrying his wife Ruqa and having Kenzo at his father’s request as the elder man could not trust the family to his son due to his greed and high temper. But his marriage did nothing to deter him from having affairs left and right even when his legal wife grew sick after catching something from him which he got himself treated for twice without telling anyone. By the time they had found it the infection had spread too far and Ruqa remained bedridden until her death a few short years later. 

But in that time she took care of Kenzo, teaching him kindness, observation, and patience before her passing. Kenzo loved his mama so much and spent all his toddler years with his head in her lap or trying to help take care of her. When she passed his grandfather took over his care, allowing him to play at the orphanage to make friends with children from different backgrounds for his own better. 

His grandfather Kousuke had been a gangster his whole life but was not a man without honor. Never traded drugs, helped girls on the street be safe, near gave loads out to good people, charged protection money only from other gangs and other riffraff. What he did may have not always been legal but it was never completely immoral or needlessly cruel. That's why he could never trust his seedy spendthrift son but adored his kind-hearted grandson. Kousuke had hoped to live long enough to see Kenzo to adulthood so he could pass his role as head to him, but there is no beating the reaper when he comes knocking on your door. After his death, the family fell to Kyoya and with no one to keep him in check all hell broke loss. He disregarded all his father's wishes and plunged the group into depravity, doing shady dealings with whoever would pay and abusing the trust his family has built over generations to swindle others. He went so far as to dump his two illegitimate children at the orphanage after falling to get their mothers to get rid of them.

And with Kenzo, the man could barely be called a father, barely seeing the boy for the first decade of his life then throwing him into strict training to help him run the brutal business he now operates. God, Kenzo hated that man, despite how hard others tried to protect him from the truth Kenzo couldn’t miss what was right in front of him. No matter how hard Kyoya tried to break him Kenzo refused to be a man like him. His resistance coupled with the support of his friends made the young lad stronger. He wouldn’t let the cruel crock destroy the last bit of happiness he had and fought tooth and nail to keep it. He wouldn’t let his brothers be sent on drug missions or taken to sketchy clubs, and when Kyoya orders Daichi, Shiro, and Haichiman to get wrist tattoos to be considered part of the family, ones that would brand them all permanent grunts under his control, Kenzo refused to let it happened, quoting his grandfather on their family way towards tattoos.

“No matter the stripes we carry the ink we bear shall connect us, our bidding black blood. For we are an army built of many, not an empire ruled by one!”

This resilience and adherence to the old way endeared him to the older members, many telling him he was the spitting image of his grandfather in his youth. Kyoya couldn’t stand that, that his son was held in such high regard when he had been deemed at failure by his own father even on his death bed! So he arranged a situation to take everything from Kenzo. 

He had planned the ambush, aiming to kill all of Kenzo’s sworn brothers and leaving the boy so traumatized that he would never go against him again. But he’d underestimated the people his son chose, and when the boy came back wearing more war scars than he’d ever had Kyoya knew getting rid of them now would be impossible. Kenzo had faced a werewolf and lived without a single life lost in the process and scared the hell out of Kyoya. 

So he sent him and his friends away, hoping to buy himself some time to figure out another way to make his son submit before the boy realized he could simply overpower him. Kenzo agreed to leave but not without all his family, including his half-siblings he and his friends helped raise in his father's place. Before departing he was given a bank account to receive his allowance and a parting gift from his mother’s family, something she’d prepared for his first year of high school. A tiny Shiba Inu pup from her family's breeding farm.

Now Kenzo off to a new horizon with his friends and little family, wishing to make as many happy memories with the ones he loves as he can.

Now, Where does Peach come into this?

While he actually meets her a little after Daichi first sees Hana. Peach is with her Titi at Port Promise for a busy deal while Kenzo isn’t far away at the local farmer's market. Peach goes to get something to drink and ends up finding a lost child, Sanjiro, wandering around. She tries to ask him where his parents are but the boy can’t hear well and doesn't even speak the same language. So she picks him up and walks him around the open market. At some point, he asks her name through gestures, and since he can’t really hear she points to a picture of a peach on a fruit stand. Eventually Kenzo finally finds them and is super grateful to Peach for keeping his brother safe. He’s also gets kind of enchanted by her, being from a largely homogenous country Kenzo is still really unused to seeing people like her.  

Her voice was something he’d only heard in movies and her eyes were a pretty warm brown color that looked kinda like rich honey. And her skin seemed to glow under any light. She spoke so kindly but properly, everything about her just seemed so charming. He didn't get a chance to ask her name before she had to run back to find her aunt but Sanjiro referred to her as Momo-chan when asked on the way home. He doesn't see her again until Daichi confesses to having a crush, Hachi reveals he met them and fell for the alien girl, eventually leading to a photo of all four girls popping up. He doesn’t say anything about, not wanting to get in way of his brothers’ love life by adding to the mess but once Shiro starts hanging over Tiara he figures this couldn’t get messier than they already are. 

Both being from big money backgrounds with a harsh period during their formative years plus both having shitty dads the two clicked very easily. Little do either know that their fates run deeper as the yakuza family Peach’s dad owes money to was Kenzo’s……and his father is still hunting him down to get it back, by any means necessary. It's very much a ticking time bomb but neither will know until it goes boom!",0.08129275952805363,8,1

On social media we are without a doubt one of the front runners, but that’s not even our biggest strength... Our biggest strength is IRL. What Kendu is doing IRL is unprecedented and will set the standard for many cycles to come. Yes, at first glance these claims may sound preposterous, but if you do a bit of research, you will see that I have a point.

 Here is a list of the current Kendu IRL initiatives:

Kendu is currently sitting at a market cap around 10 million with an ATH of 283 million, we have around 18k holders and are on 3 chains:Ethereum(native), Solana and BASE. We are over a year old, have survived multiple, brutal redistributions. We have appeared on a Coinbase advert and have achieved 50k Certik votes(only other coin to do this is Pepe).

2025-04-23,"Sudden issues between my Akita and Shiba Inu We got our Akita boy a couple months ago, he’s about 6 months old. We already had a 4 y old Shiba Inu female (she’s fixed).

Since we were gone for a couple days and left the Akita at a friend to visit family and we picked our boy up again, the two dogs have been headbutting.
Akita tried stealing a treat from Shiba after he already finished his and walked into the other room to her. I don’t wanna say he attacked her but as he tried stealing, the Shiba was trying to protect her food and he “showed her who is boss”. Obviously we stepped in immediately.

We had the same situation with a plush toy that my Shiba had and was snarling at the Akita when he tried to also mouth at it and he again got mad and gave her a bite and took the toy.

To me it looks scary but it could also be that it’s a rank type thing. The Shiba is and was very dominant but I guess now that he’s maturing he’s not having it anymore. Still I am concerned and wanted to ask for anyone else’s thoughts on this and if I should be worried/take other steps.

2025-04-22,"REPORT THIS EHEHEHEHHEE The Battle Cats: A Deep Dive into its Enduring Appeal and Cultural Impact
Introduction: The Unlikely Rise of Feline Warfare
In the vast and ever-evolving landscape of mobile gaming, where trends shift like desert sands and fleeting fads capture the attention of millions before fading into obscurity, a peculiar and undeniably charming title has carved out a unique and enduring niche: The Battle Cats. Developed by PONOS Corporation, this seemingly simple tower defense game, characterized by its bizarrely endearing cat characters and deceptively strategic gameplay, has amassed a global following that transcends age, language, and cultural barriers. What began as a quirky Japanese mobile game has blossomed into a multifaceted franchise, encompassing not only the core gaming experience but also a plethora of merchandise, collaborations, and a vibrant online community. To truly understand the enduring appeal of The Battle Cats, one must delve deep into its core mechanics, its distinctive aesthetic, its surprisingly intricate strategic depth, and the intangible qualities that have allowed it to resonate with such a diverse and dedicated audience for over a decade. This essay aims to undertake such an exploration, dissecting the various facets of The Battle Cats phenomenon and analyzing the reasons behind its remarkable longevity and cultural impact.
The Genesis of the Feline Front: A Humble Beginning
The origins of The Battle Cats can be traced back to the early 2010s, a period that witnessed the rapid proliferation of mobile gaming and the emergence of diverse genres catering to a wide range of tastes. Amidst the deluge of puzzle games, endless runners, and casual simulations, PONOS Corporation, a Japanese game developer with a history of creating unconventional titles, introduced The Battle Cats in November 2011 in Japan, followed by a global release in 2012. The initial premise was deceptively simple: players control a base that continuously generates currency, which is then used to deploy an army of cats to defend against waves of increasingly bizarre and often humorous enemy creatures. The objective of each stage is to destroy the enemy base while protecting one's own.
However, beneath this seemingly straightforward gameplay lay a foundation of strategic depth and a unique visual style that immediately set The Battle Cats apart from its contemporaries. The characters, the titular Battle Cats, were not sleek, majestic felines; instead, they were deliberately rendered in a crudely drawn, almost amateurish style, often exhibiting exaggerated features and comical expressions. This deliberate aesthetic choice, far from being a limitation, became one of the game's most defining and endearing characteristics. The sheer absurdity of cats transformed into tanks, sumo wrestlers, and even mythical creatures, all animated with a quirky charm, created an immediate sense of novelty and lightheartedness.
The gameplay itself, while rooted in the familiar tower defense formula, introduced subtle yet significant variations that contributed to its addictive nature. The resource management aspect, requiring players to balance the rate of currency generation with the cost and deployment timing of their units, added a layer of tactical consideration. The diverse range of cat units, each with its own unique abilities, attack ranges, and specializations, encouraged experimentation and the development of personalized strategies. Furthermore, the gradual introduction of new enemy types, each possessing distinct characteristics and requiring different counter-strategies, ensured that the gameplay remained engaging and challenging over time.
The Unfurling Roster: A Symphony of Absurdity and Utility
One of the key pillars of The Battle Cats' enduring appeal lies in its vast and ever-expanding roster of cat units. From the humble Cat, the basic melee unit that serves as the initial building block of any army, to the extravagantly powerful and strategically nuanced Uber Rare units, the sheer variety of feline combatants is staggering. Each cat is meticulously designed, not only in terms of its visual presentation but also in its in-game function.
The early game introduces players to fundamental unit types, such as the Tank Cat, providing a durable frontline defense, and the Axe Cat, offering slightly longer range attacks. As players progress, they unlock access to more specialized units, each fulfilling a specific role in combat. Anti-Metal units, for instance, are crucial for dealing with heavily armored metallic enemies, while Anti-Floating units excel against airborne adversaries. Area-of-effect attackers can clear out large groups of weaker enemies, while single-target specialists can focus their damage on more resilient threats.
The introduction of Rare, Super Rare, and Uber Rare units further deepens the strategic complexity. These higher-tier cats often possess unique abilities, such as critical hits, area attacks with special effects (like knockback, freeze, or slow), increased attack range, or even the ability to revive after being defeated. Obtaining these rare units through the game's gacha system adds an element of chance and collection, encouraging players to invest time and resources in building a diverse and powerful army.
The visual design of these cats is where the game truly shines. The developers at PONOS have embraced a spirit of unbridled creativity and often hilarious absurdity. Players can field units like the Gross Cat, a disturbingly elongated feline, the Ninja Cat, a stealthy assassin, the Dragon Cat, a miniature fire-breathing beast, and the Jizo's Moving Castle, a bizarre fusion of a cat and a medieval fortress. The sheer imaginative scope of these designs, coupled with their fluid and often comical animations, contributes significantly to the game's overall charm and memorability.
Beyond their aesthetic appeal, each cat unit is carefully balanced within the game's ecosystem. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different units, their cost, their cooldown times, and their effective matchups against various enemy types is crucial for success in the more challenging stages. Players are constantly encouraged to experiment with different unit combinations, adapting their strategies to the specific threats they face. This dynamic interplay between unit variety and strategic application is a key element in The Battle Cats' enduring replayability.
The Enemy Menagerie: A Motley Crew of the Bizarre
Just as the Battle Cats themselves are a testament to imaginative design, the enemies they face are equally bizarre and often humorous. The game features a vast and ever-expanding bestiary of creatures, ranging from mundane animals imbued with unusual powers to utterly outlandish and surreal entities.
Early stages introduce players to basic enemy types like Doge (a Shiba Inu with surprising resilience) and Snache (a surprisingly fast snake). However, as players progress through the various chapters and event stages, they encounter a menagerie of increasingly peculiar foes. There are Hippoe, a hippopotamus with a surprisingly powerful bite; Croco, a menacing crocodile; Pigeon de Sable, a flock of aggressive pigeons; and Teacher Bear, a surprisingly tough and persistent ursine educator.
The creativity extends far beyond recognizable animals. Players will face enemies like the Shy Boy, a ghostly figure that phases in and out of existence; the Cyberface, a robotic head with laser beams; the Angelic Hippoe, a winged behemoth; and the dreaded Bore, a massive, tusked creature capable of dealing devastating damage. Each enemy type possesses unique attributes, such as varying attack ranges, attack speeds, health pools, and special abilities like knockback resistance, the ability to slow down cat units, or even the power to resurrect fallen allies.
The sheer unpredictability of the enemy encounters is a significant factor in the game's enduring challenge. Players must constantly adapt their strategies and unit compositions to effectively counter the specific threats they face. Learning the attack patterns and weaknesses of different enemy types is crucial for survival, and the game often rewards players who are willing to experiment and think outside the box. The humorous and often absurd nature of the enemy designs further enhances the game's overall charm, preventing the constant cycle of combat from becoming monotonous.
The Strategic Canvas: Layers of Tactical Depth
While The Battle Cats may initially appear to be a simple game of deploying cute felines to overwhelm bizarre enemies, beneath the surface lies a surprisingly intricate layer of strategic depth. Success in the game, particularly in the later and more challenging stages, requires more than just spamming high-level units. Players must carefully consider a multitude of factors to emerge victorious.
Resource Management is paramount. The game's currency system, which steadily replenishes over time, dictates the rate at which players can deploy units. Balancing the need to build up a sufficient reserve of funds with the urgency of deploying units to counter incoming threats is a constant strategic consideration. Knowing when to invest in worker cat upgrades to increase currency generation and when to conserve resources for a powerful push is crucial.
Unit Composition is another critical element. As mentioned earlier, the vast roster of cat units offers a wide range of abilities and specializations. Building a balanced team that can effectively handle different enemy types and attack ranges is essential. Players must consider the cost, cooldown times, and effective matchups of their units to create a cohesive and adaptable army.
Timing and Deployment are also key to success. Knowing when to deploy specific units to maximize their impact can be the difference between victory and defeat. Timing the deployment of area-of-effect attackers to coincide with waves of weaker enemies or strategically positioning long-range units to target vulnerable backline threats requires careful observation and anticipation.
Base Management, while seemingly simple, also plays a role. Upgrading the cat base unlocks various passive bonuses, such as increased worker cat efficiency and stronger base defense. Knowing when to invest in these upgrades can provide a significant advantage in the long run.
Special Abilities and Items further enhance the strategic possibilities. Many cat units possess unique triggered abilities that can be activated during battle, such as powerful single-target attacks or area-of-effect debuffs. Additionally, the game features various consumable items that can provide temporary advantages, such as increased attack power or faster unit deployment. Utilizing these abilities and items strategically can turn the tide of even the most challenging battles.
The introduction of new game mechanics over time, such as Cat Combos (passive stat bonuses granted by deploying specific combinations of cats) and Talents (upgradeable passive abilities for individual units), has further deepened the strategic complexity of The Battle Cats, ensuring that long-time players continue to find new ways to optimize their strategies and overcome increasingly difficult challenges.
The Gacha Gauntlet: The Thrill of the Draw
A significant aspect of The Battle Cats' gameplay loop, and a common element in many mobile games, is the gacha system. This system allows players to spend in-game currency (Cat Food) or real money to draw random cat units, with varying probabilities of obtaining rarer and more powerful units.
The gacha system introduces an element of chance and collection that can be both exciting and, at times, frustrating. The thrill of drawing a highly coveted Uber Rare unit can be immensely satisfying and can significantly impact a player's ability to progress through the game. The anticipation and the visual spectacle of the gacha animation contribute to this sense of excitement.
However, the inherent randomness of the gacha system can also lead to disappointment, as players may spend significant resources without obtaining the desired units. This element of chance is a deliberate design choice that encourages continued engagement and, for some players, the expenditure of real money to improve their odds.
The gacha system in The Battle Cats is structured in various ways, with different banners offering different pools of units and varying probabilities. Limited-time events often feature exclusive units that can only be obtained during specific periods, further incentivizing players to participate. The game also incorporates mechanics like guaranteed Uber Rare draws after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts, which can alleviate some of the frustration associated with the randomness.
While the gacha system is a core component of The Battle Cats' monetization strategy, the game is generally considered to be generous enough that players can progress through a significant portion of the content without spending real money. The strategic depth of the gameplay ensures that skill and tactical thinking can often compensate for a lack of the absolute rarest units.
The World of Cats: A Journey Across Continents and Dimensions
The Battle Cats unfolds across a sprawling world map, divided into various chapters and sub-chapters, each with its own distinct theme and increasing level of difficulty. The initial chapters take players on a whimsical journey across the globe, with stages set in recognizable locations like Japan, Europe, and America, albeit populated by increasingly bizarre enemies.
As players progress, the narrative, while lighthearted and often absurd, expands to encompass more fantastical and otherworldly settings. They will venture into ancient Egypt, explore the depths of the ocean, travel to the moon, and even delve into alternate dimensions. Each new chapter introduces unique enemy types and environmental challenges, requiring players to adapt their strategies and utilize different cat units.
Beyond the main story chapters, The Battle Cats features a wealth of additional content, including event stages that offer unique rewards and limited-time units, challenge stages that test players' skills with specific restrictions, and collaboration events that bring characters and themes from other popular franchises into the world of The Battle Cats. This constant influx of new content ensures that the game remains fresh and engaging for long-time players.
The narrative, while not the primary focus of the gameplay, adds a layer of charm and context to the chaotic feline warfare. The brief cutscenes and character descriptions often inject humor and personality into the world of The Battle Cats, further endearing the bizarre cast of characters to the players.
The Community Claws Its Way In: A Global Phenomenon
The enduring success of The Battle Cats is not solely attributable to its engaging gameplay and quirky aesthetic; a significant factor is the vibrant and dedicated global community that has sprung up around the game. Players from all corners of the world connect online to share strategies, discuss unit strengths and weaknesses, celebrate their gacha pulls, and create fan content.
Online forums, social media platforms, and dedicated wikis serve as hubs for this community, providing valuable resources for both new and experienced players. Players share their winning strategies for challenging stages, offer advice on team compositions, and analyze the stats and abilities of different cat units. The collaborative nature of this community fosters a sense of camaraderie and shared passion for the game.
The creation of fan content, including artwork, animations, and even fan-made games, further demonstrates the deep connection that players have with The Battle Cats universe and its characters. This organic expression of creativity helps to keep the game relevant and reinforces its cultural impact.
PONOS Corporation actively engages with the community through social media channels and in-game events, often incorporating player feedback and suggestions into the game's development. This responsiveness fosters a sense of partnership between the developers and the players, contributing to the game's long-term success.
The Purr-manent Appeal: Why The Battle Cats Endures
After over a decade since its initial release, The Battle Cats continues to thrive in the competitive mobile gaming market. Its enduring appeal can be attributed to a confluence of factors:
Uniqueness and Charm: The game's distinctive art style and the sheer absurdity of its premise and characters set it apart from other mobile games. The crude yet endearing designs and the humorous animations create a lighthearted and memorable experience.
Strategic Depth: Beneath the seemingly simple gameplay lies a surprisingly intricate layer of strategic depth that keeps players engaged and challenged. The vast roster of units, the diverse enemy types, and the various game mechanics encourage experimentation and tactical thinking.
Constant Evolution: PONOS Corporation has consistently updated The Battle Cats with new content, including new units, new stages, new game modes, and collaborations with other popular franchises. This constant influx of fresh material prevents the game from becoming stale and keeps long-time players invested.
Accessibility and F2P Friendliness: While the gacha system is a monetization element, The Battle Cats is generally considered to be relatively free-to-play friendly. Skilled players can progress through a significant portion of the game without spending real money, and the daily rewards and regular events provide ample opportunities to earn in-game currency.
Strong Community: The vibrant and dedicated global community provides a valuable resource for players, fosters a sense of belonging, and contributes to the game's overall longevity through shared knowledge and fan-created content.
Nostalgia and Familiarity: For players who have been with the game since its early days, The Battle Cats evokes a sense of nostalgia and familiarity. The ongoing updates and the introduction of new content alongside familiar elements create a comforting and engaging experience.
The Cultural Paw Print: Beyond the Game
The impact of The Battle Cats extends beyond the realm of mobile gaming. Its unique characters have become recognizable icons within certain online communities, and the game has spawned a significant amount of merchandise, including plush toys, figurines, and apparel. Collaborations with other popular franchises, such as Hatsune Miku, Evangelion, and Street Fighter, have further broadened its reach and introduced its quirky charm to new audiences.
The game's success in Japan, a country with a rich history of unique and often bizarre pop culture, is particularly noteworthy. The Battle Cats has tapped into a sensibility that appreciates the unconventional and the humorous, resonating deeply with Japanese audiences. Its global success demonstrates the universality of its core appeal, transcending cultural differences through its engaging gameplay and endearing characters.
The longevity of The Battle Cats also serves as a testament to the power of originality and the importance of fostering a strong connection with players. In a market saturated with generic clones and fleeting trends, The Battle Cats has carved its own path by embracing its unique identity and consistently delivering engaging and entertaining content.
Conclusion: A Decade of Feline Domination
In conclusion, The Battle Cats is more than just a mobile game; it is a cultural phenomenon that has captured the hearts and minds of millions worldwide. Its enduring appeal stems from a potent combination of quirky charm, surprising strategic depth, constant evolution, a supportive community, and a commitment to its unique identity. From its humble beginnings as a bizarre Japanese mobile title, The Battle Cats has grown into a multifaceted franchise with a lasting impact on the landscape of mobile gaming. As it continues to evolve and introduce new waves of bizarre feline warriors and outlandish enemies, one thing remains certain: the reign of The Battle Cats is far from over, and its purr-manent appeal will likely continue to enchant players for years to come. The unlikely rise of these crudely drawn cats to global stardom is a testament to the power of originality, the importance of community, and the enduring appeal of a good, strategically engaging, and utterly bizarre game. The battle continues, one adorable and absurd feline at a time.

2025-04-22,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

I'm really glad we had this Uptrend cycle because I was excited to watch the dojis play out through the charts, and encouragingly, we have higher HIGHS and higher LOWS. We need to approach this with some caution, though, and breaking it down through the Indicators will help understand a little better what is happening and what we can expect. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers began stepping in, but the stable appreciation was consistently met with profit-taking over multiple time frames, leading to a Weak, Neutral level. Buyers hold a fair amount of control of the market, yet they are chipping away at a ‘Profit-Taking Sell Wall’. Trend Indicators showed that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, which outlines our Bullish Uptrend, yet Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand again, signaling Bullish Consolidation when the two are combined. ADX values signal an Average level of Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, meaning we currently have a robust level of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support Bollinger Band expansion, with Volatility rising to the Neutral end of our norms range. Sustained price movements ABOVE the Volatility Bands support an outlook of pressure building for a Consolidation of gains.

Volume Indicators highlight increased levels of participation, which have kept an even level of counteracting pressure against the profit-taking, leaving money flow at a near-Neutral level, yet more remains flowing in than out. Sentiment Indicators revealed that Buyers are continuing to accumulate at stronger levels than the distribution of profit-taking, which continues to nurture a positive Trend cycle in the Short term, yet the profit-taking continues to lend further strength to the negative Trend cycle, as seen by the decline of the PVT value slipping even further today. News articles were overwhelmingly Bullish with Sentiment for Shiba Inu, with projections of drastic moves, breakout patterns, and technical indicators which are driving a narrative of a substantial rally incoming with the additional, continued shift from MEME to real world adoption and Utility. They have isolated articles with cautions, but these continue to show the ongoing effort to counter FUD/FOMO by using fact-based insights to help investors stay attentive to market dynamics.

The Trend is clearly Bullish and Buyers are gradually taking greater control of the market, but Volatility continues to remain LOW and, to me, that indicates a Consolidation phase. We continue to have breakouts from some of our Bands, which supports further gains, but Volume at Neutral means that we should expect to continue testing higher Support levels with temporary Consolidations and minor pullbacks. Any surge in Volume would help confirm the market environment for some of the more cautious investors waiting on the sidelines.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is currently testing the ‘Wall of Resistance’, attempting to follow the 4-Week retracement path up to the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. As we are BELOW this level, I won't consider this our MAX; rather, it would be the market's attempt to capture a Short term Neutral major pivot point. I see a scenario of Consolidation where there's a defined stall range that I noticed, with the 18-Day moving average resting at $0.00001420 and the 18-Day moving average just BELOW it at $0.00001400. I would say that our MAX would be the height of that stall range, which converges with the 38.2% retracement of our 13-Week LOW at $0.00001420. If we breach this level, we will confirm the 13-Week retracements and establish the 50% retracement of our 13-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001540 as the next MAX target. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to the 50% retracement of our 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. If this triggers a stronger pullback, it would fall down to the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001240.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they’re the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-22,"Thyroid meds doing harms rather than helping??? My 4-year-old Shiba Inu has been battling skin allergies for over 2 years. We’ve tried oral meds, topical treatments, and Cytopoint injections. In 2024, bloodwork showed he has hypothyroidism, so he started thyroid meds.

Two things:

1. For almost a year on meds, His allergy symptoms never fully went away—even with Cytopoint + thyroid meds. He still gets itchy and has had recurring skin and ear infections.
2. He never gained weight (still \~22lbs).

Late 2024, he had a bad skin infection, so the vet prescribed antibiotics. I also *stopped* the thyroid meds around that time. For \~4 months without thyroid meds or Cytopoint, he had no issues. 

10 days ago, during a routine visit, the vet advised restarting the thyroid meds. I did—and now he has another ear infection.

Is it possible the thyroid meds are contributing to his skin/ear problems rather than helping? 

Also our shiba has always been a timid dog. I almost had doubt if he really has hypothyroidism. ",-0.15999999999999998,0,13

**Why You Should Join a Meme Coin Investing Group Chat: The Ultimate Guide to Turning Laughs into Gains**

If you've spent any time online in the past few years, you've definitely come across meme coins—cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and more recent entrants that started as jokes but ended up delivering serious profits. What started as internet humor quickly turned into an explosive, culture-driven phenomenon that continues to disrupt traditional finance. The question is: are you just going to watch it happen, or are you going to get involved?

If you’ve ever thought about investing in meme coins—or if you already are—you *need* to be in a group chat. And not just any group chat, but one filled with like-minded, motivated, and informed people who are chasing profits and having fun doing it.

Here’s why joining a meme coin investing group chat might be one of the best moves you make in your crypto journey.

---

### **1. Real-Time Alpha (Insider Info)**
Meme coin markets move FAST. By the time mainstream crypto Twitter is talking about a coin, the early birds have already made their money. Group chats are where you’ll often hear about these plays first—from someone who saw a trending post on Reddit, TikTok, or Telegram, or who’s been deep in the project’s Discord.

These communities act like living, breathing trend radars. They’re constantly on the lookout for undervalued gems, stealth launches, and early projects that have moon potential. When you’re in a good group chat, you’re not investing alone—you’re investing with a collective mind that watches the market 24/7.

---

### **2. Learn From Others**
If you’re new to meme coins, navigating the space can be overwhelming. What’s a rug pull? What’s a honeypot? How do you use Uniswap or PancakeSwap? What even is gas?

These are the types of questions that you might feel awkward asking on public forums—but in a group chat, there’s no pressure. You’ll find people who are more experienced and happy to help guide you. Think of it like crypto office hours. Ask, learn, grow.

Even if you're a seasoned investor, you’ll pick up tips and tricks from other experienced degens. From chart analysis and liquidity pool breakdowns to tokenomics and community sentiment, you’ll absorb knowledge just by being part of the convo.

---

### **3. Avoid Scams and Rug Pulls**
The meme coin space can be wild. With every legit opportunity comes a dozen shady projects. A good group chat acts as a filter—you get collective due diligence from people who can sniff out red flags and bad vibes.

Members will often share contract audits, developer wallet tracking, or even personal experiences with certain coins. You’re far less likely to fall for a scam when you have 50 other people helping you vet every opportunity.

---

### **4. Memes + Money = Fun**
Let’s be real—investing in meme coins isn’t *just* about profit. It’s fun. It’s chaotic. It’s exciting. Group chats reflect that vibe. Expect lots of memes, GIFs, inside jokes, and pure entertainment, all while you’re watching your portfolio pump.

Crypto can be stressful. But when you’re in a group chat, even the losses hurt less when you can laugh about them with friends. And when you win? You get to celebrate those gains with people who get it. It’s a community. A tribe. A digital degen family.

---

### **5. Community-Driven Projects**
Some of the most successful meme coins started with just a small group of believers who hyped, bought in early, and pushed the project to the moon. Group chats are often the launchpads for these kinds of movements.

Sometimes, the group *becomes* the project—members pool resources, create their own coin, and promote it together. If you’re in early, that’s when the real upside happens.

Being in the right group chat can put you at the ground floor of the next viral token. You’re not just watching crypto history—you’re making it.

---

### **6. Motivation and Momentum**
Let’s face it: staying motivated in crypto can be hard when you’re doing it alone. Maybe you bought a few coins, they dipped, and you feel discouraged. Or you don’t know what move to make next.

In a group chat, you’re surrounded by people chasing the same goal: financial freedom, one meme coin at a time. That energy is contagious. Seeing others succeed pushes you to keep grinding, researching, and trying again.

It’s like having your own crypto accountability squad—people who’ll keep you in the game when it gets tough, and cheer you on when you score.

---

### **7. Early Whitelists, Giveaways, and Airdrops**
Another big perk of being in a solid meme coin group chat is access to exclusive opportunities. Devs often reach out to active communities with whitelist spots for new launches, airdrop giveaways, and early access tokens.

If you're part of an engaged chat, you’ll get first dibs on these chances. And trust me—getting into a presale before the public knows about it? That’s where real money is made.

---

### **8. Grow Your Network**
Crypto isn’t just about coins—it’s about people. You never know who you might meet in a meme coin group chat. It could be a future business partner, a dev with a project, an influencer, or just a really sharp trader whose insights change how you look at the market.

These chats are more than just channels for tips—they’re communities where friendships are formed, collaborations happen, and doors open. It’s not what you know, it’s who you know—and in crypto, who you know *can* make you rich.

---

### **So… Ready to Join?**
If you’ve read this far, you’re probably at least *curious* about what it’s like inside one of these group chats. Maybe you’ve been trading on your own, refreshing CoinGecko every 10 minutes, or lurking on Twitter trying to find the next 100x play.

Stop going solo. Come join the hive mind.

There’s power in community. There’s profit in information. And there’s potential in memes. Don’t wait for the next Dogecoin to pass you by while you’re on the sidelines. Plug into a meme coin group chat and *be* early for once.

Whether you’re here for the money, the memes, or the movement—we’ve got a spot for you. All you have to do is join.

Let’s chase those gains together.

**What did all these coins have in common? Was it some secret strategy? A paid KOL?**  


**The answer is simple, all they had was a community. A relentless, unstoppable community who did not take no for an answer. Day after day, week after week, month after month they plugged away working hard and not selling, to push their coin to the top. There is no magic solution…..**

https://preview.redd.it/0ti6nmfyo9we1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a35e528582bc109cd071c484ffcce6e35cfded47

Kendu understands this and that’s why we just work, work , work. Chads/Chadettes are logging in daily, smashing tweets, Reddit posts, Instagram posts, IRL shilling and whatever else. We know that with enough hard work anything is possible and if you have been in crypto long enough, you will have realised that we are not work shy!

The game is simple, Kendu is everywhere and it has been proven time and time again that community determines the value of a meme coin. All the signs are there, Kendu is my only play and it is going to the tens of billions. Kendu’s social media dominance rivals the very best on Twitter and we have completely taken over the vast majority of crypto subreddits with our engagement through the roof. On social media we are without a doubt one of the front runners, but that’s not even our biggest strength... Our biggest strength is IRL. What Kendu is doing IRL is unprecedented and will set the standard for many cycles to come. Yes, at first glance these claims may sound preposterous, but if you do a bit of research, you will see that I have a point.

 Here is a list of the current Kendu IRL initiatives:

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals!

Kendu is currently sitting at a market cap around 10 million with an ATH of 283 million, we have around 18k holders and are on 3 chains:Ethereum(native), Solana and BASE. We are over a year old, have survived multiple, brutal redistributions. We have appeared on a Coinbase advert and have achieved 50k Certik votes(only other coin to do this is Pepe).

With IRL presence off the charts and Social Media presence that rivals coins with a market cap over 10x Kendu’s, it is obvious. **All the signs are there**  
Kendu is destined to reach the tens of billions and we will get there with you or without you, but do yourself a favour and **join the winning team, join Kendu**

2025-04-21,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We entered into Consolidation as expected, but it was quite encouraging to see Buyers step into the dip, meaning they were waiting along the sidelines for entry. Momentum Indicators show that this price stabilization is contending with profit-taking as Buyers lead the market in Weak control over multiple time frames through Bullish Consolidation. Trend Indicators signal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are expanding, confirming the Consolidation. ADX values show Strong Trend strength holding the price ABOVE the Supertrend and Long term EMAs while remaining BELOW the 12-Day EMA. This signals Trend continuation and highlights stable ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion with Volatility rising near the Neutral zone but still in the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are falling near the LOW of our Volatility Bands, remaining WITHIN their range and further supporting Consolidation.

Volume Indicators offer some encouragement by showing increased participation from investors entering the market through the dips and smoothing the flow of money, leaving a Neutral level with barely more continuing to move in than out. Sentiment Indicators reveal Strong accumulation through the dips while nurturing the Short term positive Trend cycle; yet despite the dip buying, profit-taking has lent even more strength to extend the negative Trend cycle, as seen by the PVT value decline even further today. News articles remain Bullish while using technical indicators, token burns, and reversal patterns which continue to reshape the narrative from MEME to Utility. At the same time, they offer caution with signals like scam warnings, potential traps, and Bearish price predictions which work to ease FUD/FOMO by offering fact-based insights.

I can see that Buyers are edging in and the price is sitting comfortably near our Support levels while Volatility remains subdued, and all this is characteristic of Consolidation before a breakout. However, Short term Volume headwinds remain and I can see us continuing with gradual gains where the market might retrace to some of our LOW Band boundaries before establishing a solid breakout. This is an interesting moment.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is right ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. This acts as our Short term Neutral major pivot point and, given that we are following such defined price dynamics, we may press a little bit lower to test the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210, which would be the test of the full Neutral range from Short to Long term. At LOWEST, the price will touch the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ and cross BELOW the 9-Day moving average at the 1st standard price deviation at $0.00001210. As before, if we breach this level, we would immediately go down to a well-defined stall range where the 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150. At MAX, the price will continue to try to reach that next 4-Week retracement level at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290, and this would be the market's attempt to establish a higher Short term Neutral major pivot point. Extending beyond this point would mean that the next test would be our 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360.

2025-04-21,"See ya 'round, old man I put my best friend of 15 years down last Thursday.

When I picked him up at the shelter it was between two siblings and a Shiba Inu. But the girl was sweet, dropped off at the police station, 6 months old. Then he walked up and pushed her nose down.

That's him, I want that one. They named him Elvis. NOPE. Buster hound/mix

Excited, loved everyone. Already neutered and chipped. Get him in the car and he started shivering with fear. ""Shit, I should have picked you sister."" Took a long time to get him over his fear of riding.

He was intended to be a guard dog. We had goats and chickens. A little too good at it so he quickly adapted to being a house dog. Nothing like pulling him off a raccoon at 3 in the morning.

He had to go to dog jail for biting two Jevoiah Witnesses that snuck up on him on the porch. ""Hang on, I'll put him up"" and they are gone. 20 minutes later a cop is on the street.
His tag was out by 2 weeks so everyone pretended like he had rabies. Broke the latch to his lead so they made me fix it. I joked about breaking quarantine and had to leave him there again.

That is another hard habit to break when 80% of people are afraid of him. Flinchers, man. or let their little kid or loose dog wander up to him.
We'd find some woods. Get a little lost together instead.

We tried a lot of vets but the people at my local Banfield knew how to handle him. He had have a major shoulder surgery for a benign tumor. That sight when I picked him up... gory, stapled up, and out cold.
Sat with him for a week out in the workshop while he healed. Army of the Dead sucks by the way.

He dropped all his weight last winter, which, at his age that ain't that odd. Trouble taking the steps to our room. Had to move him downstairs, which he hated. That and with wisdom comes accidents. You know, when I broke the surface tension of sick dog diarrhea for the first time, it was the 2nd worst smell I've ever had the pleasure of retching to.

Already priced around for euthanasia but I didn't want his scared mind's last memory being in a new place with people he didn't know.

It had to be home.

And it was getting time. Time to let go, old man.

Stood vigil for 5 nights. He'd almost let go. Still too much fight in him. Called MobileVet Memphis (HIGHLY RECOMMEND) and a very sweet person came out. Only took a second.
All she wrote for Buster Jones

And of course he was a good dog. He just had to trust you. Dug so many animals graves, I just, couldn't do his for some reason. I pick up his ashes tomorrow.

Oh and moving his corpse gave him one last chance to get diarrhea on me.",-0.015977792892686492,5,3

Ich hab in den letzten Monaten viele dieser Plattformen ausprobiert – einige waren totaler Schrott, andere überraschend gut. Immediate Prism ist definitiv eine der interessanteren.

Krypto-Trading wird immer beliebter, vor allem weil es inzwischen Plattformen gibt, die das Ganze auch für Einsteiger zugänglich machen. Immediate Prism reiht sich genau dort ein – mit einem modernen Interface, KI-gestützten Funktionen und dem Versprechen, Trading einfacher und schneller zu machen. Klingt gut, oder?

## Was ist Immediate Prism App?

Die **Immediate Prism App** ist eine **automatisierte Krypto-Trading-Plattform**, die besonders für Anfänger optimiert wurde. Sie nutzt angeblich fortschrittliche Algorithmen, um Marktbewegungen vorherzusagen und den Usern beim Kauf und Verkauf von Kryptowährungen zu helfen – schnell, einfach und effizient. 

Das Spannende daran: Man muss nicht stundenlang Charts analysieren oder sich mit komplizierten Börsen auskennen. Immediate Prism übernimmt den Großteil der Arbeit und bietet euch gleichzeitig die Möglichkeit, manuell einzugreifen, falls ihr das möchtet.

### [👉 Starte noch heute mit dem Trading auf Immediate Prism App](https://tinyurl.com/yeb8zmnr)
## Wer hat Immediate Prism App entwickelt??

Hier wird’s ein bisschen mysteriös. Wie bei vielen dieser Plattformen gibt es **keine öffentlich bekannten Entwickler oder ein klares Unternehmen im Hintergrund**. Laut meiner Recherche ähnelt Immediate Prism anderen Plattformen wie **Bitcoin Code** oder **Immediate Edge**, was darauf hindeutet, dass es sich um ein Team handelt, das bereits Erfahrung mit ähnlichen Projekten hat.

Das muss aber nicht unbedingt schlecht sein – viele erfolgreiche Trading-Bots wurden anonym entwickelt. Trotzdem wäre etwas mehr Transparenz schön gewesen. Ein Impressum oder Infos über das Entwicklerteam würden hier für mehr Vertrauen sorgen.

## Immediate Prism App Vor & Nachteile

**Vorteile:**

- **Einfache Benutzeroberfläche**, ideal für Einsteiger
- **Kommissionsfreies Trading**, keine versteckten Gebühren
- **Paper Trading Modus** zum risikofreien Üben
- **Schnelle Kontoeröffnung**, in unter 10 Minuten startklar
- Zugriff auf **viele wichtige Kryptowährungen** wie BTC, ETH, SOL

**Nachteile:**

- **Keine mobile App** (nur Web-basiert)
- **Anonymer Betreiber**, was bei Vertrauen eine Rolle spielt
- **Kein Demokonto ohne Anmeldung**
- **Mindesteinzahlung von 250 €** könnte für manche zu hoch sein

## Wie funktioniert Immediate Prism App?

Die Immediate Prism App basiert auf einem **KI-gesteuerten Algorithmus**, der Markttrends analysiert und darauf basierend automatisch Trades platzieren kann. Ihr könnt entscheiden, ob ihr das System automatisch handeln lasst oder selbst manuell eingreift.

Der Ablauf ist ziemlich simpel:

1. Konto erstellen
2. Mindesteinzahlung tätigen
3. Einstellungen anpassen (z.B. Risikoniveau)
4. Trading starten – entweder automatisch oder manuell

Besonders praktisch für Anfänger: Das System schlägt auf Basis der Datenlage Trades vor. Wer sich auskennt, kann diese bestätigen oder ablehnen. Wer neu ist, kann dem Algorithmus einfach freien Lauf lassen.

## Mit welchen Geräten kann man Immediate Prism App nutzen?

Immediate Prism läuft komplett **browserbasiert**, was bedeutet: Ihr braucht **keine App herunterzuladen**. Egal ob ihr einen **Windows-PC, Mac, iPhone, Android-Smartphone oder Tablet** nutzt – solange ein Browser drauf läuft, seid ihr dabei.

Das ist praktisch, da man sich keine Gedanken über Updates oder Systemanforderungen machen muss. Ich habe es auf meinem Laptop und iPhone getestet – beides lief reibungslos. Eine native App wäre trotzdem nice to have, besonders für Leute, die viel unterwegs sind.

## Immediate Prism App – Top Features

### Paper Trading

Das **Paper Trading Feature** ist ein echter Gamechanger, besonders für Anfänger. Ihr könnt mit virtuellem Geld handeln und dabei echtes Marktverhalten simulieren. So bekommt ihr ein Gefühl für die Plattform, ohne finanzielles Risiko.

Ich hab’s selbst ausprobiert: Nach ein paar Tagen wusste ich genau, wie die App funktioniert, welche Einstellungen sinnvoll sind und wie ich meine Strategie verbessern kann. Mega hilfreich!

### Kommissionsloses Trading

Immediate Prism erhebt **keine Handelsgebühren oder Provisionen** – was heutzutage eher selten ist. Ihr zahlt also **keinen Cent extra**, wenn ihr Gewinne erzielt. Das ist besonders für Vieltrader interessant, da sich Gebühren schnell summieren können.

Natürlich gibt es Spread-Kosten (also der Unterschied zwischen Kauf- und Verkaufspreis), aber das ist bei allen Plattformen Standard.

### Zugriff auf Top Krypto Assets

Die Auswahl an Kryptowährungen ist solide. Ihr könnt u.a. handeln mit:

- **Bitcoin (BTC)**
- **Ethereum (ETH)**
- **Solana (SOL)**
- **Ripple (XRP)**
- **Cardano (ADA)**

Für die meisten Trader dürften das genau die Coins sein, auf die es ankommt. Exoten wie Dogecoin oder Shiba Inu fehlen zwar, aber das ist zu verschmerzen.

## Ist Immediate Prism App Betrug oder seriös?

Ich hab das Thema **ausführlich getestet** und kann sagen: Es gibt **keine Hinweise auf Betrug**. Die Plattform funktioniert, Ein- und Auszahlungen klappen, der Kundenservice antwortet (nicht immer super schnell, aber immerhin). 

Allerdings: Der **anonyme Hintergrund** ist ein Punkt, der skeptisch machen kann. Solange man mit gesundem Menschenverstand vorgeht, also nicht gleich 10.000 € einzahlt oder blind alles dem Bot überlässt, sehe ich aber **kein Risiko**.

### [🔥 Eröffne jetzt dein Immediate Prism App Konto](https://tinyurl.com/yeb8zmnr)
## Immediate Prism App Konto erstellen

### Schritt 1: Besuchen Sie die Website

Einfach die offizielle Website der Immediate Prism App aufrufen. Achtet darauf, keine Fake-Seiten zu erwischen – es gibt viele Nachahmer!

### Schritt 2: Füllen Sie das Anmeldeformular aus

Name, E-Mail-Adresse und Telefonnummer eingeben. Dauert keine 2 Minuten. Keine Dokumente notwendig in dieser Phase.

### Schritt 3: Bestätigen Sie Ihre E-Mail

Ihr bekommt eine Bestätigungsmail, die ihr anklicken müsst. Danach ist euer Konto aktiv.

### Schritt 4: Zahlen Sie Echtgeld ein

Die **Mindesteinzahlung beträgt 250 €**. Bezahlen könnt ihr per Kreditkarte, Überweisung oder eWallet. Krypto wird (noch) nicht akzeptiert.

### Schritt 5: Beginnen Sie mit dem Trading

Jetzt könnt ihr loslegen. Entweder direkt handeln oder erst mal mit dem Paper Trading starten. Beides geht schnell und intuitiv.

## Immediate Prism App Konto löschen

Falls ihr die Plattform nicht mehr nutzen wollt, könnt ihr euer Konto über den Kundensupport löschen lassen. Ein einfacher Klick im Profil reicht *leider nicht*, was ein kleiner Minuspunkt ist. Der Support hat mein Konto aber innerhalb von 24 Stunden gelöscht.

## Minimale Einzahlung bei Immediate Prism App

Die **Mindesthöhe für Einzahlungen liegt bei 250 €**. Das ist branchenüblich, aber für absolute Anfänger vielleicht etwas hoch. Mein Tipp: Startet mit dem Demo-Modus, bevor ihr echtes Geld einzahlt.

## Gibt es prominente Unterstützung für Immediate Prism App?

Ich hab keine Beweise für **offizielle Promi-Unterstützung** gefunden. Es kursieren Gerüchte über Elon Musk oder Frank Thelen – aber die tauchen bei jeder Krypto-Plattform auf und sind meistens Quatsch. Also: **Keine Fake News glauben**.

## Immediate Prism App – unterstützte Länder

Die Immediate Prism App ist in den meisten **EU-Ländern, der Schweiz, Teilen Asiens und Nordamerikas** verfügbar. In den USA ist der Zugang teilweise eingeschränkt – vermutlich wegen regulatorischer Gründe.

## Kundenservice

Der **Kundenservice ist solide**, wenn auch nicht überragend. Ihr erreicht ihn per:

- **E-Mail** (Antwort innerhalb von 24h)
- **Live-Chat** (tagsüber erreichbar)
- Kein Telefonsupport

Ich hab drei Mal Kontakt aufgenommen – einmal wegen Auszahlungsdauer, einmal wegen Konto löschen und einmal zum Paper Trading. Alle Anfragen wurden freundlich beantwortet.

## Ist Immediate Prism App seriös – unser Testurteil

Nach meinem Test bin ich insgesamt **positiv überrascht**. Immediate Prism ist eine **einsteigerfreundliche, funktionale und gebührenfreie Plattform**, die hält, was sie verspricht.

Aber unterm Strich ist es eine **seriöse Option für alle, die ins Krypto-Trading einsteigen wollen** – besonders mit dem Paper Trading als Sicherheitsnetz.

**Meine Bewertung: 4 von 5 Sternen.** Empfehlenswert, aber nicht perfekt.

2025-04-20,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

The sustained Bullish Uptrend is stimulating Buyer activity in an attempt to get ahead of some of our Volume headwinds in the Short term. Momentum Indicators show that, despite the profit-taking, there is sustained Weak Buyer control over multiple time frames, holding the market just ABOVE some Short term Neutral benchmarks. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands have contracted even further today, which signals a growing outlook for breakout potential to test higher Resistance levels. ADX values show that Trend strength is increasing, while prices are holding ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, signaling that ‘Price Action’ remains stable. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction, with Volatility falling even further into the LOWEST end of our norms range. Price movements continue to ride AT or ABOVE the Volatility HIGH Bands, supporting a Bullish Consolidation outlook while also lending a Weak signal to the breakout potential that continues to build up.

Volume Indicators show Weak levels of increasing participation, which is encouraging as these investors are accumulating at greater levels than profit-taking is distributing. This further moves more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to signal increasing levels of Strong accumulation, with Buyers continuing to nurture a Short term positive Trend cycle. Despite this Buyer activity, profit-taking has given more strength to the Long term negative Trend cycle, as indicated by the PVT value further declining. News articles continue with a Bullish narrative covering token burns, strategic Shibarium updates, and Bullish price forecasts that evolve the coverage from MEME to Utility asset. While there are highlights of technical barriers, high concentration risk, and some scam warnings, they all help counteract FUD/FOMO while cultivating a positive Long term outlook.

Overall, the Indicators and general Sentiment remain positive and point to a Bullish outlook. The Neutral/mixed Volume signals continue to warrant caution, and I would expect a Consolidation of the gains while we proceed through a Bullish Consolidation phase until Volume increases validate a stronger Long term Uptrend cycle.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price has breached the ‘Wall of Resistance’ and is attempting to follow the retracement path of the 4-Week levels, but it has run into a stall range as indicated by the convergence of the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic, which has reached 80%, at $0.00001250. At MAX, the price will attempt in the Short term to reach that benchmark 50% retracement level of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to around the previous 38.2% retracement level of the 4‑Week LOW at $0.00001230 for a Short term Consolidation to test market direction. Falling BELOW this level would trigger a test of the ‘Wall of Support’ down to the defined stall range WITHIN the ‘Wall of Support’, where our 3-Day, 10-Day, and 16-Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150.

This is my first vallhund puppy and I'm deeply in love! We've had him now about 3 weeks now and during the week he keeps a good schedule. I've noticed that he is aware of when it is 7:15am. He starts barking and carrying on if breakfast is even just 1 minute late... I haven't had a dog that has caught on to timing this quickly and was curious if this is a perk to owning a vallhund? Or if our new little one is just incredibly aware of breakfast. 
This habit has continued to the weekends lol. I fear I've lost my ability to sleep in. Is it always going to be this way? I've never owned a herding breed.

Kendu has an enormous catalogue of IRL accomplishments and a social media presence to rival the very biggest in the space all at a market cap of 13 million, all of these initiatives have been completed when holders are in the red, imagine the volume and quality when everyone has an insane amount of money to invest???  
Kendu has an A rating on Certik and achieved the Certik audit by reaching 50k votes, the only other coin to reach this feat was Pepe! Certik is a security based company and is very, very reputable within the crypto community, you can this here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)  
Look at Shiba Inu in 2021 or Pepe, they didn’t have a KOL or anything special, it was just an average coin with an obsessed, relentless community who stopped at nothing to take it to the top. Kendu is no different in terms of relying on the power of an incredible community, however we are bringing to the table a lot more than those coins did, we are arriving with an IRL presence that is **unprecedented.** If you are reading this and you are not a Kendu holder, my advice to you would be to go on Twitter or Reddit and look around, you will see Kendu everywhere. Also, I’d recommend you join our telegram and check out our activity compared to coins that are in the hundreds of millions.  
The goal is simple and the path is clear, Kendu will be one of the top performers this cycle, this is not a coin to ignore….

2025-04-19,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We have a mixed landscape of pressures converging in the market, lending support to the Uptrend following a Short Consolidation as investors gauged the market. Momentum Indicators highlight these resilient pressures by showing Buyers increasing control of the market over multiple time frames, smoothing the price movements into a Bullish Consolidation range. Trend Indicators show the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands hold the same level of breakout potential from yesterday. ADX values are signaling increasing Trend strength through the Short term, while price movements hold ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs. This confirms that Buyers have activated stable levels of ‘Price Action’.

Volatility Indicators continue to support the Bollinger Band contraction as Volatility remains at the LOW end of our norms range. The Bullish Consolidation is well defined, with price movements placing pressure against the HIGH Volatility Bands and supporting the outlook of breakout pressure building. Volume Indicators have fallen to a Neutral level of participation, which creates a little bit of a headwind in the market. Despite the pullback and participation favoring Sellers, the counteracting Long term accumulation is grabbing those profit-taking positions and moving more money into the market than out.

Sentiment Indicators reveal that, despite the Sellers’ participation, Buyers are accumulating at a stronger rate than Sellers are distributing. This convergence of Buy and Sell pressure has led the market into a Neutral ground where the Long term negative Trend cycle has nearly been negated but is currently left at a Weak level, which is quite manageable for the market to work back through. News articles paint a Bullish picture with Strong technical signals, breakthrough price levels, and strategic developments that are steering the narrative from a MEME to one of Utility. News appears to be purposefully crafted to alleviate FUD/FOMO by grounding forecasts with factual insights, signaling a genuine shift in Sentiment.

Mixed yet encouraging signals confirm that an Uptrend is intact, yet the underlying Bearish pressures could still trigger a Short term pullback. Given these mixed signals, I see the ‘Price Action’ carrying us through Consolidation levels while the market attempts to overcome the Weak Short term Volume headwinds and break Resistance levels down to provide higher levels of Neutral Support.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting AT the Short term Neutral major pivot point at the 38.2% retracement of the 4‑Week LOW at $0.00001230, resting WITHIN the Neutral zone ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210. As before, at MAX the price will attempt to reach the next milestone retracement level at the 50% retracement of the 4‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will reach down into the ‘Wall of Support’ at a well-defined stall range where the 3‑Day, 10‑Day, and 16‑Day MACD moving averages converge at $0.00001150.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

Notes from OC Animal Care: ""Syrena"" is a sweet senior who arrived at the shelter as a stray. She did come in with a microchip, but it does not have updated owner information. She appears to be blind with a possible luxated lens in her right eye. During her intake exam, she was obsessively scratching at a spot on her right shoulder and vocalizing continuously. She would stop periodically but then continue again in short bursts. She was also noted to have a left-sided head tilt. We are concerned that she may be showing a variation of seizure activity, leading to self-inflicted wounds. (MM: or it could be an ear infection)  She was started on pain medication, antibiotics, and a mild sedative. We are monitoring her for worsening signs and are concerned that this may rapidly progress. If she declines, she may be humanely euthanized sooner. She needs a full medical workup to determine the cause and discuss treatment options available. She will meet retention on 4/19. Please let us know if your group can help ""Syrena""!

2025-04-19,"Traumatized and stubborn rescue puppy Hi everyone, 

I am an experienced dog owner, have had dogs all my life, all rescues, and varying degrees of trauma- like not domesticated and street dogs. I lost my soul dog in February to cancer and rescued an 10 or 11 month old puppy 10 days ago. 
We think she is a German shepherd-Aussie mix, but possible some Shiba Inu as well (I’ll be doing a DNA test). She was living on the streets in Georgia, thought to be part of a pack of dogs, and was caught and about to be put to sleep before being sent up north where I rescued her. Her trauma is extensive- scared of water bottles, of people, the car, being in public, sudden movements, etc. the list goes on. She was not aware what a house really was- didn’t know how to use stairs, beds, follow me around the house. All new. Anyways that’s the background on Miss Lucy. 
So in the past week, I’ve completed the house training that the shelter was working on, taught her sit, gentle, and given her love. 

Im having a problem getting her to come inside after going out (fenced in back yard). I’ve tried high reward treats, but she isn’t interested. And it turns into a game of “catch me if you can”. And she’s fast, even with a leash I have trouble catching her. I also don’t want that to be our life where she can only go out in backyards on a leash and has this bit of freedom limited to her. Any tips on training her to come inside when called? It was working a few days ago, but then she got over the treats. I tried switching treats, and that has not worked. We are working on ‘come’ inside in a smaller setting as well 

Thank you! Happy to provide any additional info if needed 

*Edit to add that even a stern “no” scares her, and I really prefer a positive reinforcement method unless she is in a dangerous situation

2025-04-18,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Well, it's obvious that we are testing the 4‑Week retracement levels in an attempt to establish higher Neutrals ABOVE Resistance prices, but I don't see an external catalyst, meaning that this is an internal dynamic and I will assess based on clustering. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers step forward and trigger a stable rate of profit-taking as the price appreciation tests the Sell Wall. This Weak level of Buyer control over multiple time frames is already beginning to show signs of being Overbought. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming an Uptrend cycle, while Bollinger Bands are contracting again, hinting at further breakout potential. ADX values support the outlook of a Consolidation of the gains, as Strong Trend strength in the Short term holds the price ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs for a Weak active ‘Price Action’ phase. Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band contraction outlook of breakout potential, with Volatility falling to the LOW of our norms range, while price movements are ABOVE the Volatility Bands, confirming Overbought conditions.

Volume Indicators signal Weak levels of participation despite the Strong price movements, while profit-taking contends with Buyers entering the market, moving more money in than out at a positive but near‑Neutral flow rate. Sentiment Indicators are showing Strong accumulation with a newly emerging positive Trend cycle in the Short term, yet it is a Long term caution to note that profit-taking at current levels is still enough to have strengthened the Long term negative Trend cycle that the market has yet to fully claw back through and contend with. News articles show stable Long term optimism, with the Bullish narrative using expert forecasts, ecosystem upgrades, initiative progress, and technical signals supporting recovery. News continues its positive influence while painting the picture of a changing recognition for Shiba Inu from MEME to Utility, while using the same Short term Volatility cautions as a way to alleviate FUD/FOMO.

I don't want to follow the general consensus and would like to just look at this in a purely technical way, because I think that, for me, it makes more sense with the elements coming together. We see a Strong Uptrend cycle being confirmed in the Momentum and Trend Indicators, while the price trades ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, EMAs, and the Supertrend, and all of this is converging ABOVE the Bollinger, Donchian, and Keltner Bands. In literal terms of classification, I call this a Consolidation breakout, but we have Volume remaining Neutral, so I'm not sure how much further we can sustain the breakout, as Bullish continuity is especially important ABOVE the 200-Day EMA. I think we need to see Long term accumulation and an improvement in OBV, MFI, and CMF values from our current levels to cultivate a positive Trend cycle of Buying activity. Putting all this together, it shows me that most likely we will Consolidate the gains at some point and may have some Short Uptrend cycles, but without an external catalyst and higher levels of Buyer activity stepping forward to support the Uptrend, it will eventually just peter out over this weekend.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is WITHIN the ‘Wall of Resistance’ just BELOW the 38.2% retracement of our 4‑Week LOW, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001230. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow the retracement path up to the 50% retracement of our 4‑Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will retreat and test the ‘Wall of Support’, with the critical level resting at the 3rd‑level Support pivot point at $0.00001130.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-18,"🚨 3 Reasons a Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rally May Be Closer Than You Think Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be facing a challenging moment, but recent indicators hint at a possible rally on the horizon. A significant factor contributing to this optimistic outlook is the dramatic surge in SHIB's burn rate, which has soared by nearly 2,000% in just 24 hours. Over 17.6 million tokens have been sent to a null address, with one mysterious transaction accounting for more than 90% of the total burnt supply.

Currently trading at approximately $0.00001192, SHIB has experienced a 5% drop over the past month. However, the explosive burn rate aims to decrease the ample circulating supply, and this could lead to an increase in value. It is important to note that for sustained price rises, there also needs to be consistent demand alongside these burning efforts.

Another key catalyst for potential price growth is the evolution of Shibarium, SHIB's layer-2 blockchain solution. Daily transactions have surged past three million, reflecting heightened user engagement within the ecosystem. This advancement is designed to enhance the Shiba Inu ecosystem by reducing fees, accelerating transactions, and continuing to burn SHIB tokens.

Additionally, we are witnessing interesting trends in SHIB's exchange netflows. Lately, outflows have been prominent, suggesting that holders are withdrawing tokens from centralized exchanges into self-custody. This movement can be viewed as a bullish sign since it lessens immediate selling pressure on the token.

SHIB's current dynamics present an intriguing blend of challenges and opportunities. With ongoing developments like increased burn rates and Shibarium's progress, there could be a turning point for this popular memecoin to reclaim momentum in the broader cryptocurrency market.

2025-04-18,"Kendu - Why Kendu will be one of the top gainers this cycle As the crypto world has been tarnished by celeb rug pulls, political rug pulls, utility rug pulls and just degenerate gambling behaviour in general, Kendu is set to stand out from the crowd. Kendu is not hopping on the next big craze, that will ultimately not last and a lot of people will be exit liquidity, Kendu is building the next multi billion dollar brand. Yes, reading this might sound crazy if you haven’t heard of Kendu’s mission, but I will try and explain it to you today!

 

Kendu is unlike the vast, vast majority of all other memecoins because we have a lot of IRL initiatives, Kendu is currently running a glow in the dark Pickleball tournament in India(shoutout to Ishan), these Pickleball tournaments are attracting a lot of attention and are enforcing the community spirit which is within all Chads/Chadettes. Kendu has also attended 3 Florida festivals in the past 6 months(shoutout to the Kendu Street Team, Inkstradamus, NoSleep305 and whoever else who helped). Last weekend Kendu was at the Florida Groves Festival in Orlando and StaySeaArt created a cool Kendu mural which will be shown below.  
At these Florida festivals, Kendu has been giving out Kendu Energy(energy drinks) and merch. This is obviously giving Kendu a big name within the festival goer community!!!

**Some General Kendu information**: Kendu is an Ethereum native memecoin, but we have bridged to both Solana and Base this year. Kendu’s We Don’t Gamble, We Work slogan perfectly encapsulates the drive, determination and unbreakable will power that the community has. Kendu is totally organic and community led, this means we do not pay any KOLs. At the time of writing this post, Kendu has nearly 18k holders and is sitting at a market cap around 13 million. Kendu has an A rating on Certik and achieved the Certik audit by reaching 50k votes, the only other coin to reach this feat was Pepe!!!  
Certik is a security based company and is very, very reputable within the crypto community, you can this here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)

Here is a list of the current Kendu IRL initiatives:

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art

 **A question to everyone for the comments, what Kendu products have you tried so far?**

https://preview.redd.it/jkat45lbwkve1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8604444fb7dc9dd5bf30ed2e430c2d1e89b43c64

Let me just say this…. All of these products have been created when the vast majority of Kendu holders are in the red. So, the average person is spending a lot of time and money to take a risk on their own project to help push Kendu forward! Where else can you see something like this?

Thanks for reading up this point, I will close with some comments and let you get on your way!  
Look at Shiba Inu in 2021 or Pepe, they didn’t have a KOL or anything special, it was just an average coin with an obsessed, relentless community who stopped at nothing to take it to the top. Kendu is no different in terms of relying on the power of an incredible community, however we are bringing to the table a lot more than those coins did, we are arriving with an IRL presence that is **unprecedented.** If you are reading this and you are not a Kendu holder, my advice to you would be to go on Twitter or Reddit and look around, you will see Kendu everywhere. Also, I’d recommend you join our telegram and check out our activity compared to coins that are in the hundreds of millions.  
The goal is simple and the path is clear, Kendu will be one of the top performers this cycle, this is not a coin to ignore….

2025-04-18,"I believe I discovered myself Therian I've always been afraid of dogs, since I was little and a very strong fear. So scared that when I needed to go to the market as a child I learned which streets had the most houses with dogs so I wouldn't pass by them. 
But for some reason I was also drawn to them as a form of identification. 
I never cared much but as I let this identification happen and started having ""dog habits"" my fear was ""cured"" and I started to live feeling much more ""found"" in life, I started to itch like a dog, I ate dog food sometimes (and I found it and I think it's very tasty, sometimes I eat too much and my doctor asked me to eat little, he said it could even make me blind due to the different vitamins there), I started to play ""hunt"" for toys, always have something to bite, these little things made a lot of sense to me and felt like something I'd always done, even though I'd never done it before.
I tried to find out more and paid for past life hypnosis with a specialist, in the experience I saw myself as a dog, specifically a shiba Inu, but without details beyond that.
The only bad thing is that I acquired a bad habit too, I'll confess to you on Reddit because I think it's safe to say things here (I looked at Reddit before making this post to make sure), I was ""urination"" in places for some instinctive reason, I feel it and I end up doing it, usually close to where I live and in places I've been visiting for some time. I want to stop this, I'm afraid of being discovered and getting into trouble, people do this on the street every day I think so I don't know either.

2025-04-17,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Despite the increase in Buyer activity, it was not quite enough to catalyze the market for a sustained Uptrend, and the market has returned to a Consolidation phase. Momentum Indicators reveal that Buyer activity remains Neutral in the Short term, resulting in Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are beginning to expand. This behavior confirms the Consolidation phase. ADX values indicate that the price is moving with Average Trend strength, hovering just ABOVE the Supertrend and around the EMA levels, which now form a very tight Resistance range. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation, as Volatility remains at the Neutral of our norms range. The Volatility Bands reinforce the Consolidation outlook. Volume Indicators are showing declining participation, which suggests ongoing profit-taking. When we examine money flow, it is clear that more money is now flowing out of the market than into it after reaching Resistance levels.

Sentiment Indicators confirm a pullback with Strong distribution in the market. Despite the profit-taking, Buyers appear to have cultivated an emerging positive Trend cycle that has reduced the strength of the Long term negative Trend cycle, as evidenced by the PVT value moving to a Neutral level. News articles offered a renewed Bullish outlook for the Medium and Long term by covering breakout levels after the Consolidation. News articles paint a Bullish narrative, highlighting expert predictions, technical signals of strategic whale accumulation, and token burns. The same cautions of Short term Volatility remain as a way to alleviate FUD/FOMO, but overall the News is still changing the narrative from MEME to ‘Utility’, which is a more fundamental encouragement in comparison to just alleviating psychological pressure by using facts. 

There are some signals of Bullish recovery showing through Momentum and Short term Trend Indicators. However, with the lingering Long term Sell resistance against Uptrends with profit-taking, it is likely that the market will continue Consolidating until an external catalyst stimulates ‘Price Action’.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is at the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001180 and is resting within the Neutral zone. At MAX, the price will attempt to reach the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‘Wall of Support’ down to a critical level at the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001100.

## Was ist MiradexTrader?

**MiradexTrader** ist eine digitale Handelsplattform, die sich auf den **automatisierten Krypto-Handel** spezialisiert hat. Das bedeutet: Du musst keine stundenlangen Charts analysieren oder auf komplizierte Trading-Signale reagieren. Die Plattform nutzt angeblich fortschrittliche Algorithmen, um gute Einstiegspunkte zu erkennen – und führt Käufe oder Verkäufe automatisch für dich aus.

Das klingt erstmal nach Science-Fiction, aber genau das macht MiradexTrader für viele so interessant. Es ist quasi wie ein digitaler Co-Pilot beim Trading – besonders wenn man noch nicht so tief im Thema steckt.

Die Plattform bietet aber auch manuellen Handel, falls du mehr Kontrolle möchtest. Besonders cool: Sie versprechen **keine Provisionen** und bieten Funktionen wie **Paper Trading**, also den Handel mit Spielgeld zum Üben. Nice für Anfänger!

### [👉 Starte noch heute mit dem Trading auf MiradexTrader](https://tinyurl.com/ytwvzppt)
## Wer hat MiradexTrader entwickelt??

Die genauen Entwickler hinter MiradexTrader sind nicht öffentlich bekannt – was in der Krypto-Welt leider nicht unüblich ist. Das Team bleibt anonym, was natürlich Fragen aufwirft, aber auch bei Plattformen wie **Bitcoin Code** oder **Immediate Edge** der Fall ist.

Was man aber weiß: Die Plattform wirkt professionell aufgebaut. Die Benutzeroberfläche ist stabil, die Verbindung läuft schnell, und die Registrierung ist sicher durch **SSL-Verschlüsselung** geschützt. Wer also Wert auf maximale Transparenz legt, wird hier ein paar Fragezeichen haben – aber ehrlich gesagt, ist das bei vielen Krypto-Brokern ähnlich.

## MiradexTrader Vor & Nachteile

Hier mal ein schneller Überblick:

**Vorteile:**
- **Intuitive Benutzeroberfläche**, auch für Anfänger geeignet
- **Keine Kommissionen** oder versteckte Gebühren
- **Paper Trading** zum Üben mit virtuellem Geld
- Zugang zu **Top-Kryptowährungen**
- **Schnelle Registrierung** ohne großen Papierkram
- **Automatisierter Handel** mit KI-Unterstützung

**Nachteile:**
- Keine Infos zu den Entwicklern
- Keine eigene App (nur Web-Version)
- Hohe Volatilität kann zu Verlusten führen
- Noch relativ unbekannt, wenig Langzeit-Feedback

Trotz der kleinen Schwächen ist der erste Eindruck definitiv positiv.

## Wie funktioniert MiradexTrader?

Die Funktionsweise ist eigentlich ziemlich simpel:

1. Du erstellst ein Konto und zahlst mindestens **250 €** ein.
2. Danach kannst du entweder manuell handeln oder den **Auto-Trading-Modus** aktivieren.
3. Der Algorithmus analysiert den Markt in Echtzeit und führt automatisch Trades durch, wenn er profitable Gelegenheiten erkennt.
4. Du kannst jederzeit in den Prozess eingreifen, Gewinne mitnehmen oder Verluste begrenzen.

Die Plattform legt offenbar Wert darauf, den Einstieg so einfach wie möglich zu machen – was gerade für Trading-Neulinge ein großer Pluspunkt ist.

## Mit welchen Geräten kann man MiradexTrader nutzen?

MiradexTrader ist eine **webbasierte Plattform**, was bedeutet: Du kannst sie über jeden modernen Browser nutzen – egal ob auf dem **PC, Tablet oder Smartphone**. Es gibt (noch) keine eigene App, aber die mobile Version der Website ist überraschend gut optimiert.

Ich hab’s selbst unterwegs im Zug ausprobiert – läuft flüssig, keine Hänger. Für Leute, die viel am Handy traden, ist das definitiv ein Vorteil. Klar, eine native App wäre nice, aber aktuell vermisst man sie kaum.

## MiradexTrader – Top Features

### Paper Trading

Das ist eines meiner Lieblingsfeatures. Du kannst mit **virtuellem Geld** üben, bevor du echtes Geld einsetzt. Perfekt für Anfänger oder wenn man einfach mal eine neue Strategie ausprobieren will, ohne gleich was zu riskieren.

### Kommissionsloses Trading

**Keine Gebühren** – das liest man selten. Bei MiradexTrader fallen keine Handelsprovisionen an. Du bekommst also den vollen Gewinn (oder Verlust 😅). Das macht das ganze transparent und fair, besonders im Vergleich zu Brokern, die sich über Spreads oder versteckte Kosten ihr Stück vom Kuchen holen.

### Zugriff auf Top Krypto Assets

Du kannst mit den wichtigsten Kryptos handeln:
- **Bitcoin**
- **Ethereum**
- **Litecoin**
- **Ripple**
- und viele mehr...

Die Auswahl ist solide, wenn auch nicht riesig. Wer mit Altcoins wie Shiba Inu oder Dogecoin handeln will, sollte sich vielleicht woanders umschauen.

## Ist MiradexTrader Betrug oder seriös?

Fairerweise: Die Plattform wirkt **seriös**, aber es ist immer gut, vorsichtig zu sein. Es gibt **keine Fälle von Betrug** oder Abzocke, die ich finden konnte. Die Webseite ist verschlüsselt, die Einzahlungsmethoden sind sicher, und auch der Kundenservice antwortet zuverlässig.

Trotzdem: **Versprechungen von hohen Gewinnen ohne Risiko** sollte man immer mit einer Prise Salz nehmen. Krypto-Handel bleibt riskant – auch mit einem Bot.

## Was ist Oro Vertix?

Oro Vertix ist eine **automatisierte Handelsplattform**, die sich auf den **Kryptowährungsmarkt** spezialisiert hat. Das Ziel: Trading für alle zugänglich machen, auch für Leute, die nicht den ganzen Tag Charts analysieren wollen oder können. Die Plattform bietet laut eigenen Angaben eine **benutzerfreundliche Oberfläche**, kommissionsfreies Trading und Zugang zu beliebten Coins wie **Bitcoin, Ethereum oder Litecoin**.

Was mir gleich aufgefallen ist: Oro Vertix wirbt nicht aggressiv mit übertriebenen Gewinnen. Stattdessen setzt die Plattform auf ein klares Interface und einfache Bedienung. Das spricht besonders Einsteiger an, die oft von zu viel Fachchinesisch abgeschreckt werden.

### [👉 Starte noch heute mit dem Trading auf Oro Vertix](https://tinyurl.com/52r36rjx)
## Wer hat Oro Vertix entwickelt??

Hier wird es ein bisschen vage. Die Entwickler der Plattform bleiben anonym – was bei Krypto-Projekten nicht ungewöhnlich ist, aber natürlich für etwas Skepsis sorgt. Trotzdem wirkt die Plattform technisch gut gemacht: Keine Bugs, schnelle Ladezeiten und ein klar strukturierter Ablauf beim Onboarding.

Man kann wohl davon ausgehen, dass **ein erfahrenes Team aus dem FinTech-Bereich** hinter Oro Vertix steckt. Ähnliche Plattformen wie Bitcoin Era oder Bitcoin Code arbeiten ebenfalls mit anonymen Entwicklerteams, was nicht automatisch negativ sein muss. Transparenz wäre zwar besser, aber ein direkter Scam sieht anders aus.

## Oro Vertix Vor & Nachteile

**Vorteile:**
- **Einsteigerfreundlich** mit simpler Benutzeroberfläche
- **Keine Kommissionen** auf Trades
- **Demo-Modus** (Paper Trading) verfügbar
- **Schnelle Kontoerstellung** ohne komplizierten Verifizierungsprozess
- **Zugriff auf beliebte Kryptowährungen**

**Nachteile:**
- **Keine offizielle Lizenz** oder Regulierung bekannt
- **Anonyme Entwickler** – wenig Transparenz
- **Kein direkter Zugang zu Wallet-Adressen**
- **Keine mobile App**, nur Web-Version
- **Minimale Einzahlung von 250€** könnte für Einsteiger hoch sein

## Wie funktioniert Oro Vertix?

Die Plattform funktioniert ähnlich wie andere **automatisierte Trading-Systeme**. Du meldest dich an, zahlst Geld ein (mindestens 250€), und kannst dann entweder **manuell traden** oder den **automatischen Handelsmodus** aktivieren.

Die Algorithmen analysieren Kursverläufe, Markttrends und setzen Kauf- oder Verkaufsorders entsprechend der ausgewählten Strategie. Es fühlt sich ein bisschen an wie ein **Autopilot für deinen Krypto-Account**. Du kannst aber jederzeit eingreifen, Positionen schließen oder neue Trades setzen.

Besonders cool: Es gibt einen **Demo-Modus**, in dem du die Plattform testen kannst, ohne echtes Geld zu riskieren. Ideal für Anfänger.

## Mit welchen Geräten kann man Oro Vertix nutzen?

Ziemlich flexibel – Oro Vertix läuft auf:
- **Desktop-PCs** (Windows, macOS)
- **Smartphones** (Android, iOS über Webbrowser)
- **Tablets**

Eine eigene App gibt es aktuell nicht, aber die mobile Version der Website ist **responsive** und funktioniert gut. Ich habe sie auf meinem iPhone getestet – klappt einwandfrei, auch wenn eine native App manchmal bequemer wäre.

## Oro Vertix – Top Features

### Paper Trading

Der **Demo-Modus** ist definitiv eines der besten Features. Du bekommst ein virtuelles Guthaben und kannst die Plattform testen, ohne echtes Geld zu verlieren. Ideal, um Strategien auszuprobieren oder sich einfach mal mit dem Interface vertraut zu machen.

### Kommissionsloses Trading

Hier punktet Oro Vertix: **Keine Trading-Gebühren**. Du zahlst lediglich den Spread – also die Differenz zwischen Kauf- und Verkaufskurs. Das macht die Plattform besonders für Vieltrader interessant, denn die Gebühren bei anderen Anbietern können sich schnell summieren.

### Zugriff auf Top Krypto Assets

Du kannst mit Oro Vertix auf die wichtigsten Coins zugreifen:
- **Bitcoin (BTC)**
- **Ethereum (ETH)**
- **Litecoin (LTC)**
- **Ripple (XRP)**
- Und einige kleinere Altcoins

Das Angebot ist solide, auch wenn echte Exoten wie Dogecoin oder Shiba Inu (noch) fehlen.

## Ist Oro Vertix Betrug oder seriös?

Die große Frage. Nach meinem Test würde ich sagen: **Eher seriös** – aber mit Einschränkungen. Es gibt keine Hinweise auf betrügerische Machenschaften, Auszahlungen funktionieren (bei mir zumindest) und der Support antwortet zügig.

Allerdings fehlt eine **offizielle Lizenz** – das sorgt bei vielen für Stirnrunzeln. Wenn dir Regulierung wichtig ist, bist du bei Anbietern wie eToro wahrscheinlich besser aufgehoben. Für risikofreudigere Nutzer ist Oro Vertix aber eine spannende Alternative.

### [🔥 Eröffne jetzt dein Oro Vertix Konto](https://tinyurl.com/52r36rjx)
## Oro Vertix Konto erstellen

### Schritt 1: Besuchen Sie die Website

Einfach die offizielle Website von Oro Vertix aufrufen. Achtet darauf, keine Fake-Seiten zu erwischen – es gibt viele Nachahmer.

### Schritt 2: Füllen Sie das Anmeldeformular aus

Name, E-Mail-Adresse und Telefonnummer reichen aus. Kein großer Aufwand.

### Schritt 3: Bestätigen Sie Ihre E-Mail

Klickt auf den Link in der Bestätigungs-Mail. Zack, fertig.

Mindestens 250€, per Kreditkarte, Überweisung oder eWallet. Die Einzahlung geht schnell, meist innerhalb von Minuten.

### Schritt 5: Beginnen Sie mit dem Trading

Ab jetzt könnt ihr loslegen – entweder im Demo-Modus oder direkt mit echtem Kapital.

## Oro Vertix Konto löschen

Wollt ihr raus? Kein Problem. Einfach den Support kontaktieren oder über das Dashboard die Löschung beantragen. Ging bei mir innerhalb von 24 Stunden über die Bühne. Achtung: Offene Positionen vorher schließen!

## Minimale Einzahlung bei Oro Vertix

Die Mindestanforderung liegt bei **250€**. Nicht wenig für Einsteiger, aber im Vergleich zu anderen Plattformen (Bitcoin Code, Bitcoin Era) ziemlich Standard. Tipp: Erst im Demo-Modus üben, bevor ihr echtes Geld einzahlt.

## Gibt es prominente Unterstützung für Oro Vertix?

Hier wird viel spekuliert, aber **nichts ist bestätigt**. Es gibt keine beweisbaren Statements von Elon Musk, Günther Jauch oder anderen bekannten Persönlichkeiten. Also: Alles mit Vorsicht genießen, wenn irgendwo Promi-Werbung auftaucht.

## Oro Vertix – unterstützte Länder

Oro Vertix ist in den meisten europäischen Ländern verfügbar, darunter:
- **Deutschland**
- **Österreich**
- **Schweiz**
- **Niederlande**
- **Spanien**

In den USA oder UK scheint der Zugang eingeschränkt zu sein. Wer sich nicht sicher ist, einfach mal die Website aufrufen – dort wird überprüft, ob euer Land unterstützt wird.

## Kundenservice

Der **Kundenservice** ist ein echter Pluspunkt. Du erreichst ihn per:
- **Live-Chat**
- **E-Mail**
- **Telefon (nach Anmeldung)**

Antworten kamen bei mir meist innerhalb von ein paar Stunden. Keine Chatbots, sondern echte Menschen – das ist heutzutage selten geworden.

### [👉 Starte noch heute mit dem Trading auf Oro Vertix](https://tinyurl.com/52r36rjx)
## Ist Oro Vertix seriös – unser Testurteil

Unterm Strich wirkt Oro Vertix wie eine **moderne, benutzerfreundliche Plattform** für alle, die unkompliziert mit dem Krypto-Trading loslegen wollen. Die fehlende Regulierung ist ein Wermutstropfen, aber die Plattform macht technisch einen soliden Eindruck.

Wer schon Erfahrungen mit Bitcoin Code oder Immediate Edge hat, wird sich hier schnell zurechtfinden. Für Einsteiger ist die Demo-Funktion Gold wert. Fortgeschrittene Trader könnten eventuell mehr Tools und Analysefunktionen vermissen.

**Mein Fazit**: Kein Scam – aber auch kein Wunderkind. Für den Einstieg super, für Profis eventuell zu simpel.

Die Plattform macht einen seriösen Eindruck, auch wenn eine offizielle Lizenz fehlt. Mein Test verlief problemlos. Sicherheitstechnisch ist SSL-Verschlüsselung an Bord.

2025-04-17,"Why Memecoins Go Viral: The Psychology Behind the Madness You’re scrolling through Twitter at 2 a.m. when you see it: a meme of a dog in a spacesuit, paired with a chart skyrocketing to Mars. Your heart races. Your fingers itch. Suddenly, you’re *this close* to dumping your savings into a coin named after a cartoon Shiba Inu.

Welcome to the wild world of **memecoin mania**—where logic dies, hype thrives, and fortunes are made (or vaporized) overnight. But why do these joke tokens explode while “serious” projects gather dust? Let’s dive into the twisted psychology fueling the madness.

# 1. The Dopamine Hit: Why Your Brain Can’t Resist a Memecoin Pump

Memecoins aren’t just investments—they’re *slot machines on steroids*. Every time a coin pumps 100% in an hour, your brain gets a hit of dopamine, the same chemical that hooks gamblers. It’s not about fundamentals; it’s about the thrill of the chase.

* **Example**: Dogecoin’s 20,000% surge in 2021 wasn’t driven by tech. It was driven by *vibes*.
* **Why it works**: Our brains crave instant gratification. Memecoins deliver faster than Amazon Prime.

# 2. FOMO: The Fuel That Ignites Every Memecoin Frenzy

Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is crypto’s secret weapon. When your cousin’s neighbor’s dog walker brags about turning 50into50*into*50k, rationality flies out the window. You *need* to get in before you’re left behind.

* **The Elon Effect**: A single Musk tweet (“To the mooooon!”) can send a memecoin vertical.
* **Reddit’s Role**: Subreddits like r/CryptoMoonShots turn FOMO into an art form.

# 3. Memes as Money: How Humor Breaks Down Barriers

Let’s face it: Bitcoin’s whitepaper is boring. Memecoins? They’re *funny*. A token named **PEPE** or **DOGE** feels accessible, relatable, and shareable. Humor disarms skepticism.

* **Case Study**: Shiba Inu’s rise wasn’t about utility—it was about an army of memes mocking Dogecoin.
* **Virality Hack**: Memes spread faster than facts. They’re the Trojan horse of crypto.

# 4. Tribes Over Tokens: The Power of Community in Memecoin Mania

Memecoins aren’t currencies—they’re *flags*. Holding DOGE isn’t just investing; it’s joining a tribe of rebels, dreamers, and shitposters. Communities on Discord and Telegram turn holders into evangelists.

* **Cult Energy**: Memecoin communities thrive on inside jokes, hype chants (“Wen Lambo?”), and collective delusion.
* **Strength in Numbers**: A passionate community can prop up a token *even if it has zero use cases*.

# 5. Rebellion Against the System: Stick It to the Suits!

Memecoins are middle fingers to Wall Street. They’re proof that a joke dreamed up by internet randos can outpace hedge fund darlings. For millennials and Gen Z, it’s not just profit—it’s *payback*.

* **Anti-Establishment Appeal**: Buying DOGE feels like sticking it to the boomers who called crypto a scam.
* **Decentralized Chaos**: No CEOs, no boardrooms—just pure, unregulated chaos.

# 6. The Dark Side: When Viral Turns Toxic

Not all that glitters is gold. Behind every “To the moon!” post lies a minefield of scams, pump-and-dumps, and life-ruining volatility.

* **Rug Pulls**: Developers vanish overnight, leaving your investment as worthless as a used NFT.
* **The Crash**: Memecoins fall faster than they rise. Many “degenerates” learn this the hard way.

# 7. How to Ride the Wave (Without Wiping Out)

Want to play the memecoin game? Here’s how to survive:

* **Rule 1**: Never invest more than you’d spend on a PlayStation.
* **Rule 2**: Assume every memecoin is a scam—until proven otherwise.
* **Rule 3**: Cash out profits early. Greed is the Grim Reaper of crypto.

# Final Thoughts: Madness or Genius?

Memecoins expose the raw, irrational heart of human behavior. They’re equal parts exhilarating and terrifying—a reminder that money, at its core, is just a shared delusion.

So, are memecoins the future of finance… or a cautionary tale?

2025-04-17,"The Ultimate Checklist: How to Vet Memecoins and Avoid Scams **A step-by-step guide to navigating the high-risk, high-reward world of meme cryptocurrencies**

# Introduction

Memecoins have become a cultural phenomenon in crypto, blending humor, community, and speculative trading. While projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have seen astronomical gains, the space is rife with scams, rug pulls, and abandoned projects. In 2024 alone, over 15,000 memecoins were launched daily on platforms like [Pump.fun](http://Pump.fun), but most vanished within weeks311. This guide will walk you through **10 critical checks** to avoid losing your funds to scams and maximize your chances of spotting legitimate opportunities.

# 1. Investigate the Team Behind the Project

**Why it matters:** Anonymous developers are a hallmark of rug pulls. Scammers often hide behind pseudonyms to evade accountability.

* **Check for doxxed teams:** Look for publicly identifiable founders with verifiable LinkedIn profiles or prior project experience. Avoid projects where the team is entirely anonymous.
* **Beware of “fake influencers”:** Some projects pay influencers to promote tokens without disclosing partnerships. Cross-check endorsements with the project’s official channels.
* **Example:** The Squid Game token rug pull in 2021 involved anonymous developers who disappeared after disabling sell functions, leaving investors with worthless tokens.

# 2. Audit the Smart Contract

**Why it matters:** Flaws or malicious code in smart contracts allow developers to drain liquidity or manipulate token supply.

* **Third-party audits:** Legitimate projects hire firms like CertiK or Hacken to audit their code. Avoid tokens without audit reports.
* **Renounced ownership:** Verify if developers have relinquished control of the contract. Projects like “unruggable” tokens often lock ownership to prevent tampering.
* **Code transparency:** Open-source projects allow community review. Use tools like Etherscan or Solscan to inspect the contract for hidden functions (e.g., a “rugPull()” method).

# 3. Analyze Tokenomics and Supply

**Why it matters:** Poor tokenomics lead to hyperinflation or pump-and-dump schemes.

* **Circulating supply:** Memecoins with unlimited or excessively large supplies (e.g., Shiba Inu’s 590 trillion tokens) often struggle to maintain value.
* **Whale wallets:** Use blockchain explorers to check if a small group holds most tokens. For example, 69% of SHIB is controlled by just 15 wallets.
* **Locked liquidity:** Ensure liquidity pools are locked for months using platforms like Unicrypt. Scammers often drain pools shortly after launch.

# 4. Scrutinize the Community and Social Proof

**Why it matters:** Organic communities drive long-term success; fake followers signal scams.

* **Engagement quality:** Active Discord or Telegram groups with regular updates are positive signs. Avoid projects with bot-filled communities or censored criticism.
* **Social media traction:** Check for authentic engagement (comments, retweets) versus purchased followers. The Squid Game token, for instance, leveraged hype but lacked genuine community support.
* **Partnerships:** Verify collaborations with reputable brands or blockchain platforms. Fake partnerships are a common red flag.

# 5. Avoid Projects with Unrealistic Promises

**Why it matters:** Memecoins promising guaranteed returns or “100x gains” are often Ponzi schemes.

* **Yield farming traps:** Projects offering absurd APYs (e.g., 1,000%+) typically collapse once new investors dry up.
* **No utility:** Most memecoins lack use cases beyond speculation. Ask: *Does this token solve a problem or rely purely on hype?*.
* **Pressure tactics:** Scammers use FOMO (fear of missing out) to rush investments. Take time to research — legitimate projects won’",-0.038542896497441956,1,0

Und ich muss sagen, ich war positiv überrascht.

Mit dem Boom um automatisierte Krypto-Plattformen wie **Bitcoin Era** oder **Immediate Edge** kommt auch Swap Lasix immer öfter ins Gespräch. Gerade für Leute, die keine Vollzeit-Trader sind, aber trotzdem mitmischen wollen, scheint das Ganze ziemlich attraktiv. Ich habe das Ding mal auf Herz und Nieren getestet – und teile hier meine ehrliche Einschätzung.

Die Plattform bietet eine Kombination aus **Trading-Bot**, **Marktanalyse** und **Benutzerfreundlichkeit**, die gerade für Einsteiger ziemlich attraktiv ist.

## Wer hat Swap Lasix entwickelt??

Das Entwicklerteam hinter Swap Lasix bleibt – wie bei vielen dieser Plattformen – im Hintergrund. Es gibt keine konkrete Person oder Firma, die öffentlich als Erfinder genannt wird. 

Das ist nicht unbedingt ein Nachteil. Auch bei bekannten Plattformen wie **Bitcoin Era** oder **Immediate Edge** ist die genaue Herkunft unklar, was in der Krypto-Welt fast schon Standard ist. Wichtig ist, dass die Plattform funktioniert, transparent ist und keine offensichtlichen Red Flags zeigt – und das ist bei Swap Lasix bisher der Fall.

## Swap Lasix Vor & Nachteile

**Vorteile:**

- **Einsteigerfreundlich**: Intuitives Interface, auch ohne Vorkenntnisse nutzbar
- **Keine Kommissionen**: Du behältst 100 % deiner Gewinne
- **Paper Trading möglich**: Ohne Risiko testen
- **Zugang zu den wichtigsten Krypto-Assets**
- **Schnelle Kontoeröffnung**: In unter 5 Minuten startklar
- **Mobil nutzbar**: Auch unterwegs traden kein Problem

**Nachteile:**

- **Anonymer Anbieter**: Keine klaren Infos zum Entwicklerteam
- **Nicht in allen Ländern verfügbar**
- **Kein echter Demomodus mit Live-Daten**
- **Manche Funktionen wirken noch etwas basic**

## Ist Swap Lasix Betrug oder seriös?

Nach meinem Test würde ich sagen: **Swap Lasix ist seriös**, aber mit den typischen Einschränkungen, die bei anonymen Trading-Plattformen gelten.

Ich habe keine dubiosen Abbuchungen erlebt, Auszahlungen kamen an, und der Kundenservice hat auf meine Anfragen reagiert. Trotzdem sollte man wie immer vorsichtig investieren – und nicht mehr einzahlen, als man bereit ist zu verlieren.

Ein vollständiges Impressum fehlt, was bei Kryptoprojekten leider häufig so ist. Das macht es nicht automatisch zu einem Scam, aber man sollte es im Hinterkopf behalten.

2025-04-17,"🚨 Dogecoin Price Enters Final Stage Of Pullback After Crash Below $0.16 Rattles Investors The Dogecoin saga continues as its price plunges like a rollercoaster since December 2024, dropping over 50% in just four months. But fear not, meme coin lovers! Trader Tardigrade, the handsome crypto analyst, believes we may be nearing the end of this pullback—let's get ready for a possible pump!

Looking at the charts, the MACD and RSI indicators are showing echoes of 2024. Just like before the explosive 400% rally, we’re seeing some consolidation in the MACD, hinting that Doge might just be getting ready for its moment in the sun again. The RSI divergence is also mimicking last year's patterns, stirring excitement among traders seeking that sweet, sweet moonshot. 

Now, if history is anything to go by, we could see another gallant leap for Dogecoin, inching ever closer to those all-time highs around $0.73. A resurgence here could set off a meme coin stampede, lifting Shiba Inu and other hopefuls along for the ride.

Of course, folks, the market is a fickle friend, influenced by macroeconomic dynamics and the political landscape. With the tariff war only on pause, things could go either way. So hold onto your Doges tight, because this ride is just getting started!

2025-04-16,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

We’re right about where we've been over the past couple of days: holding in a sideways Consolidation phase testing both the Support and Resistance ranges. Momentum Indicators show increases in profit-taking, yet only show Sellers coming out with Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, confirming the Consolidation phase, while Bollinger Bands are doing as they did a few days ago and are increased by a value of 1. This indicates a crossroads of Bearish or Bullish Consolidation, but still continues to hint at breakout potential. ADX values indicate that the current price is moving with resilient, Strong Trend strength extending into the Long time frames, while the price remains BELOW the Supertrend but ABOVE our 12-Day EMA. Though we have some Buyer activity in our dips, we remain BELOW our Long term EMAs, revealing the lack of ‘Price Action’ in the current market. Volatility Indicators seem to support breakout potential, as Volatility has declined to the LOW end of our norms range, while price movements are beginning to place pressure toward the HIGH Volatility Bands. This further seems to support breakout potential.

Volume Indicators signal a small increase in investor participation through both Short and Long term time frames, yet profit-taking has led to more money flowing out of the market than in. Sentiment Indicators now reveal Strong levels of distribution, lending more strength to the Long term negative Trend cycle. New articles continue to highlight technical catalysts and a Long term Bullish bias, using expert forecasts of substantial gains. Despite the Long term narrative of appreciation expectations, the Short term narrative highlights the same Volatility possibilities but uses these articles to urge the use of stop losses and ways to gauge the market through technical signals rather than emotion. Seems that even in a Consolidation phase, the News continues to play an avid role in alleviating FUD/FOMO. 

These charts show me that we're in a position to shift towards Bullish Consolidation, but as Supports and Resistances are holding so firmly, this would only serve to test those levels again before reversing to a Bearish Consolidation. I see hints of Bullish Volatility and Long term Volume accumulation hiding beneath the surface, but these are not yet at a current level that could reverse or catalyze the market. It seems that we are at a crossroads and should expect continued Consolidation.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that we have reached back up to capture the Neutral zone, resting at the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001190. At MAX, we will reach back up to try to test the old faithful 38.2% retracement of our 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, we will reach down and test the ‘Wall of Support’ until popular Indicators start showing Oversold conditions and present a Buy opportunity in a dip where the 3rd-level Support pivot point at $0.00001120 would constitute a Support BOTTOM.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world. 

The petition still needs your help. Make sure to check it out and help our community with your signature. Together, we can make great changes, and through Shiba Inu, we can harness the collective power of this community.

wir haben einen 4 Monat alten Shiba Inu. Zunächst haben wir Bosch Junior gefüttert und sind dann auf Empfehlung auf das kaltgepresste Futter von Markus Mühle „Black Angus“ Junior umgestiegen. Alles Trockenfutter und dabei würden wir auch gerne bleiben.

Bei dem Bosch Futter hat Sie sich ständig gekratzt und der Kot war auch sehr unterschiedlich. Mit dem Futter von Markus Mühle kratzt Sie sich gefühlt noch mehr und muss aufstoßen. Außerdem muss Sie deutlich mehr und größeren Kot ablassen. 

Im Futterhaus wurde uns jetzt die Marke belcando empfohlen. Davon sind wir allerdings auch nicht überzeugt. Durch Recherche sind wir auf das Futter von Vet-Concept gestoßen und überlegen das mal zu probieren. 

Ich weiß, dass es hunderte Meinungen zu dem Thema gibt und wir wahrscheinlich noch weiter suchen müssen.

2025-04-16,"什么是MEME代幣的进化后的MEME2.0? # MEME2.0：新一代迷因幣的崛起與分析

# 一、MEME2.0 的起源與定義背景

區塊鏈中的「MEME2.0」指的是新一代的迷因加密貨幣（Memecoin）浪潮。第一波迷因幣如 Dogecoin 和 Shiba Inu 強調趣味與社群狂熱，在社群媒體助推下價格飆漲，但多數缺乏實質應用。經過2021年的瘋狂後，2023年開始業界思考迷因幣如何沉澱價值，於是出現了「MEME2.0」的概念：指那些兼具**文化底蘊**、**強大社群共識**，並具備**實際應用延展性**的優質迷因幣，它們正努力突破純投機屬性、構建新的價值體系，被視為新一輪迷因行情的核心驅動力。簡言之，MEME2.0 是對迷因幣的升級，融合區塊鏈新技術或應用場景，以期擁有更長久的生命力和價值支撐。

MEME2.0 概念的興起與數個背景因素有關：一是**公鏈技術進步與支持**。例如Solana等高性能鏈由於交易費用低廉、速度快，吸引了大量迷因項目部署，催生出Bonk、WIF、BOME等爆紅的Solana迷因幣，帶動整體生態繁榮。二是**迷因文化的演進**，從單純惡搞走向與現實事件和名人效應結合——如2024年美國大選期間出現大量「名人迷因幣」，前美國總統川普的 $TRUMP 代幣在短短48小時內市值飆升至770億美元，一度超越狗狗幣，但隨後因缺乏實際用例迅速歸零。這凸顯了只有炒作而無支撐的迷因幣風險，也為新一代迷因幣注入思考：如何結合**實用性**與**持續社群動能**。三是**跨界融合的探索**，愈來愈多開發者嘗試將迷因幣與Web3其他領域結合，形成「meme+」的創新模型。例如公鏈項目開始主動扶持迷因幣以拉動生態用戶，DApp產品發行迷因代幣作為營銷手段，甚至引入AI、DeFi等元素，使迷因幣具備某種實用功能。這些趨勢共同孕育了MEME2.0的誕生，使迷因幣從純粹網路玩笑逐漸演變為具備部分實際價值、與Web3深度融合的新事物。

# 二、主要代表幣種及其特點與現狀

在MEME2.0浪潮中，出現了多個具有代表性的迷因幣項目，涵蓋不同公鏈和平臺。以下挑選數個典型案例，說明其特色、發展情況、市值與社群現況：

* **Dogwifhat (WIF)** – *來自Solana社群的當紅狗狗迷因幣*：WIF 是Solana生態在2023年底崛起的一隻迷因幣，新奇之處在於它的吉祥物形象是一隻戴著粉紅針織帽的柴犬。該項目於2023年11月在Solana上發行，憑藉低手續費環境和推特等社群的病毒式傳播，短時間內聚集了大量支持者。WIF在高峰期每枚價格突破3美元，總市值一度超過30億美元，成為Solana上最成功的迷因幣之一。這背後歸功於其**強大的社群動員**——WIF社群不僅在網路上產生大量迷因梗圖與討論，還展現出高度的凝聚力，使該幣登上多家主流交易所並保持高流動性。此外，WIF團隊和貢獻者持續推動開發與市場營銷，強調這不僅僅是「一隻戴帽子的狗」，而是象徵著面向未來交易的創新符號。目前WIF流通供給固定（據官方稱無預挖），社群依舊活躍，Solana的高效基礎設施也為其提供了良好支撐。WIF的成功展示了迷因文化結合高性能鏈所迸發的能量，被視為MEME2.0的標竿之一。

*Dogwifhat（WIF）以戴帽柴犬為形象，是 Solana 生態最成功的迷因幣之一，社群狂熱推動其價格一度突破 $3 美元。圖為錢包中顯示的 WIF 資產示例。*

* **Book of Meme (BOME)** – *創新公平發行的迷因2.0先驅*：BOME（迷因之書）是在2024年初迅速走紅的一個迷因幣，採用了引人注目的**公平發射模式**。與傳統代幣發行常有私募、預挖不同，BOME在發行時「無私募、無預挖、無團隊配額」。所有參與者在啟動期間向指定地址捐贈SOL，以此按比例獲得BOME代幣，而所有募得的SOL全部注入流動池，確保公開透明。這種創新機制大大激發了市場熱情：BOME上線後短短數天內市值即衝破10億美元大關，創下加密史上最快達到十億市值的紀錄之一。如此亮眼的表現使BOME迅速躍居迷因幣市值排名前列（曾排名第7，僅次於DOGE、SHIB、Pepe等資深迷因幣）。BOME的獨特之處還在於其名稱與文化梗——「迷因之書」彷彿象徵彙集社群智慧的經典，引起好奇。同時，完全公平的參與環境滿足了社群對**公正與共創**的嚮往。BOME的成功也帶動了一波模仿熱潮，許多新項目紛紛採用類似的公平發行手法，進一步活躍了Solana生態。不過，隨之而來的也有品質參差不齊的跟風迷因，提醒投資者需保持警惕。綜觀其發展，BOME從0起步到高點時流通市值超十億美元，體現了MEME2.0時代**機制創新**\+**社群驅動**的巨大威力。目前BOME雖從峰值回落（2024年底市值約5.5億美元，排名跌至300名左右），但其作為現象級案例已載入迷因幣發展史。
* **Pepe (PEPE)** – *青蛙迷因引爆以太坊迷因季*：Pepe幣是在2023年引發全球關注的迷因幣代表。它基於知名網路迷因「Pepe the Frog」（青蛙佩佩）形象，沒有預挖和明確的實用功能，由匿名團隊在以太坊發行。Pepe靠著「好玩」的概念和活躍的社群在2023年4月迅速竄紅。憑藉Reddit、Twitter等社群的病毒式傳播，Pepe價格在短短幾周內飆升數千倍，最高市值一度超過10億美元，使其躋身主流迷因幣行列。Pepe的社群熱度極高，大量投機者湧入，交易量在2023年5月初達到高峰。然而，由於缺乏後續開發和應用支撐，Pepe後續出現大幅回調，經歷了「過山車」行情。儘管如此，Pepe證明了迷因文化在加密市場的破圈威力——一個源自表情包的代幣也能引發數十萬人追捧。Pepe的成功開啟了以太坊上的新一輪迷因季，其後衍生出一系列動物或表情包主題的代幣。但同時也使投資人更趨謹慎，開始評估項目是否有長遠價值與真正的社群凝聚力，而非僅憑FOMO情緒接盤。Pepe作為「迷因2.0元老」，是將純迷因以極致方式推向市場巔峰的例證。
* **狗狗幣 & 柴犬幣（Doge & SHIB）** – *早期迷因幣鼻祖與其演進*：雖然Dogecoin（狗狗幣）和Shiba Inu（柴犬幣）屬於更早期的迷因幣，但了解它們的發展有助於對比MEME2.0的革新之處。Dogecoin早在2013年以玩笑性質創建，2021年因Elon Musk等名人助威而暴漲3300%，價格高點達到約0.73美元，市值進入前十。Shiba則自稱「Dogecoin殺手」，在2021年借勢狗狗幣熱度迅速壯大，一度擁有龐大市值和持有人數。這兩者奠定了迷因幣「**社群至上**、媒體炒作\*\*」的1.0時代典範，但也因缺乏應用而飽受爭議。進入迷因2.0時代後，Doge與SHIB社群亦嘗試賦予代幣更多用途，如Dogecoin的支付應用場景擴展、Shiba Inu開發去中心化交易所和元宇宙計畫等。然而，相較新興的MEME2.0項目，它們更像**基礎IP**或「迷因文化旗幟」，仍主要依賴於長年累積的龐大粉絲和名人影響力支撐市值。2025年初Dogecoin市值約100億美元，Shiba Inu約60億美元，穩居迷因板塊前列，但增長趨勢趨緩。它們的存在提醒我們：迷因幣若無創新，熱度終會退卻；唯有不斷融入新的元素，才能在競爭激烈的市場中續命。
* **FO (FO.COM 生態迷因幣)** – *資本與社群結合的新秀*：$FO 是2025年初備受矚目的MEME2.0新項目。該代幣隸屬FO.COM Web3生態，由「桃花源Paradise NFT」社群衍生而來，背後獲得傳統大資本錢峰雷等人支持。Paradise NFT 本身銷售額曾高達2481萬美元且持有者忠誠度極高，為 $FO 埋下了堅實的社群基礎。FO 團隊強調**資金、團隊、社群、敘事四重Buff**加持：有雄厚資金背書、強運營團隊推動，加上原有NFT玩家社群共識，以及「傳統資本進軍Web3」的故事性。在Pudgy Penguins發幣$PENGU、Rune Stone NFT空投$DOG等NFT+代幣案例接連爆紅的背景下（$PENGU 上線即飆至約23億美元市值，Rune Stone空投$DOG 短期內市值衝破10億美元），FO的問世被視為順應潮流，或將引爆新一輪資金狂潮。目前FO剛剛發行不久，具體市值和流通數據尚在形成階段，但其相關NFT市值已超1億美元，社群熱度高漲。投資者寄望FO能成為迷因2.0時代的「大金狗」——既有迷因的病毒傳播力，又有實際生態支撐的一顆潛力股。

以上項目只是代表性案例，此外還有許多值得關注的迷因2.0幣種。例如：**Bonk**（Solana社區在2023年初空投推出的狗頭幣，強調社區公平且一度活躍度冠絕Solana）、**BABYDOGE**（BSC上由官方支持的萌犬幣）、**TURBO**（由藝術家利用ChatGPT創造的AI青蛙幣，發行成本僅69美元卻在一年內狂飆至逾6億美元市值）等等。這些迷因2.0項目或在**分發機制**、或在**題材結合**上各具特色，但共同點都是試圖在迷因狂熱外衣下尋求更深的價值內涵與持續發展的可能。

# 三、投資潛力分析：熱度與風險並存

從投資角度看，MEME2.0 項目往往**高風險高回報**，市場熱度與潛在隱患並存。我們可以從以下幾方面來評估其投資前景：

* **市場熱度與趨勢**：迷因幣板塊在過去幾年多次掀起熱潮，特別是在牛市氛圍中往往表現搶眼。當前被稱作「本輪牛市核心敘事」之一的正是迷因熱潮。資金充裕時，投資者願意博弈高風險資產，迷因幣因具備爆發性的故事傳播力，容易獲得關注。例如川普話題、AI熱點、NFT空投等都成為迷因幣起飛的導火索。許多MEME2.0項目在短時間內創造神話般的漲幅（如前述Turbo三個月內暴漲超20倍、BOME數天內市值破十億），顯示出極高的市場追捧度。另一方面，交易所也樂於順應熱度上架迷因幣，新項目一旦登陸主流交易所又會反過來刺激價格上漲。因此，**短期市場熱度**無疑是MEME2.0投資的一大助力，只要整體加密行情不陷入低迷，迷因幣板塊往往能周期性地引發投機浪潮。
* **風險因素**：迷因幣投資的風險同樣不容忽視。首先是**波動極端**：由於缺乏內在價值支撐，迷因幣價格漲跌幾乎全憑市場情緒驅動，暴漲後常伴隨暴跌。名人迷因幣 $TRUMP 從市值700億美元高點迅速歸零的案例觸目驚心。其次是**項目質量參差**：迷因板塊門檻低，充斥著跟風與欺詐。不少開發者僅為圈錢發布毫無後續的代幣，導致rug pull（捲款跑路）事件頻發。2024年下半年迷因項目數量暴增但生命周期縮短、敘事難以沉澱，就是內卷加劇的表現。第三，**莊家操縱與不公平分配**問題：部分迷因幣背後存在大戶壟斷籌碼或團隊黑箱操作，散戶往往在接盤時遭受損失。一些迷因2.0項目嘗試透過公平發行來降低此風險（如BOME的無預挖模式），但仍需警惕後續交易中的洗盤行為。第四，**市場趨勢影響**：當整體加密市場資金轉向防禦性資產時，迷因幣會首當其衝下跌。2025年初就出現資金從Solana等迷因主戰場流出、轉進比特幣ETF等穩健標的的情況。因此，投資MEME2.0須有隨時應對劇烈波動的心理準備，並做好止盈止損策略。
* **實際應用價值 vs. 純炒作**：判斷一個MEME2.0項目是否具有長遠投資價值，關鍵在於其是否建立了**除炒作以外的實際應用或強社群生態**。部分迷因幣純屬惡搞，沒有任何產品和功能，此類通常只能短線博弈，最終價值趨近於零。而MEME2.0主打的賣點正是賦予迷因幣一定的應用場景或工具屬性。如前述Time.fun、Monsters.fun等平台型項目，本身就有可持續運營的產品，代幣在其中扮演功能角色，這類項目有機會沉澱長期價值。而一些明星NFT社群發行的代幣（如Pudgy Penguins的 $PENGU）背靠成熟IP與商業計畫，未來應用前景相對明朗。以 $PENGU 為例，其發行後不僅作為NFT持有者回饋，也計劃在Pudgy元宇宙生態中流通，初始亮相即獲市場高度認可（上線首日成交額達9000萬美元、估值約23億美元）。再如TURBO，雖然是迷因幣，但創建過程本身成為一個實驗性藝術項目且吸引了開源社群參與，這賦予其某種文化價值。當然，多數迷因幣聲稱的「應用前景」可能流於噱頭，投資者需甄別真實性。如果一個項目在炒作熱潮退去後仍保持用戶活躍、開發更新不斷，則說明它不僅僅靠炒作支撐，這樣的MEME2.0才有可能成為長線黑馬。總的來說，目前大部分迷因幣投資價值偏向短線投機，具備實際應用支撐的少之又少，需要特別慎重評估。

# 四、MEME2.0 與 Web3.0、元宇宙的關聯性

作為加密世界的一股特殊力量，MEME2.0 不僅在資本市場掀起波瀾，也與Web3.0理念和元宇宙生態產生諸多交集。下面從應用場景、技術融合、社群文化三方面探討其關聯：

**1. 應用場景拓展：遊戲、社交、NFT 等的結合**  
MEME2.0 項目積極探索在Web3應用中的落地場景，試圖擺脫僅作為投機工具的定位。其中一大方向是**遊戲化**。像 [*Monsters.fun*](http://Monsters.fun) 平台讓用戶創建屬於自己的AI數位怪獸，並透過**角色扮演遊戲（RPG）+代幣經濟**的模式，讓這些怪獸代幣可以進行回合制戰鬥，怪獸會從每次對戰中學習進化。由於每個AI怪獸都綁定在一個對應的代幣上，戰鬥勝利和AI成長可以為代幣帶來價值提升，實現遊戲與加密經濟的結合。這種模式將傳統GameFi進一步趣味化——代幣本身就是角色，玩家在獲取樂趣的同時參與代幣價值共創，充分體現了元宇宙中數位資產**可玩性**與**經濟性的融合**。另一熱門場景是**社交互動**。例如 [*Time.fun*](http://Time.fun) 打造的是一個「時間代幣化」的SocialFi平臺，讓網紅KOL將自己的時間以NFT/FT形式發行，每單位時間成為可交易資產。粉絲購買後可兌換KOL的一對一諮詢或互動服務，使抽象的影響力透過代幣轉化為具體回報。Solana聯合創始人 Anatoly（@toly）等數十位意見領袖已入駐，甚至引發了“Toly’s Minutes”代幣被瘋搶的熱潮。這類平臺將迷因式的追星文化和實用社交價值結合，一定程度上創造了**Web3版「粉絲經濟」**。此外，NFT 與迷因幣的結合也是MEME2.0的重要場景。許多知名NFT系列開始發行代幣作為社群治理或獎勵，比如前述 Pudgy Penguins 的 $PENGU，以及例如無聊猿BAYC衍生的 $APE（雖不完全屬於迷因幣，但也帶有IP文化屬性）。這些代幣讓NFT持有者在元宇宙生態中有更多參與感，同時吸引非NFT用戶透過代幣間接涉入該IP世界。總的而言，MEME2.0正廣泛滲透到**遊戲（GameFi）**、**社交（SocialFi）**、**藝術收藏（NFT）等Web3領域，提供趣味性同時賦予代幣一定實用功能，這與Web3.0強調的用戶參與**與**社群自治**理念不謀而合。

**2. 技術融合創新：結合 AI、DeFi、身份系統**  
MEME2.0不再侷限於簡單的代幣發行，許多項目勇於嘗試將前沿技術融合進迷因幣生態，以提升代幣的實用性和話題性。其中一個典型融合是**AI（人工智慧）**。最著名的例子莫過於 *Turbo* 幣的誕生——藝術家 Rhett Mankind 完全依賴 ChatGPT 來協助構思和創建合約代碼，僅用69美元預算便生成了一個迷因代幣。這種人機協作的創新本身成為賣點，Turbo在推出一年後市值飆升至超過6億美元，證明AI融入加密創作可以引發巨大的市場興趣。同時，一些平臺將AI代理人直接引入運營機制，如前述Monsters.fun和Nad.fun。*Nad.fun* 是 Monad 鏈上的社交迷因發射平臺，它不但鼓勵用戶在X（推特）上轉發內容賺取積分、爭取空投，還允許 **AI Agent** 參與其中：透過推薦鏈接和互動，AI代理人也能替用戶完成任務並獲得獎勵。這開創了AI替人理財、參與社群的新模式。在金融融合方面，MEME2.0也嘗試結合 **DeFi** 元素。例如一些迷因幣提供質押(Staking)獎勵或流動性挖礦，將社群持幣熱情轉化為DeFi中的鎖倉價值；又或引入機制對抗MEV（最大可提取價值）以保證小戶交易公平性，正如Nad.fun內建抗MEV機制來防止巨鯨搶跑。還有項目探討**數位身份（DID）與迷因的結合，如發行代幣代表某種網絡身份或榮譽，持有人可在元宇宙中獲特殊權限，這在某種程度上讓迷因幣承載社群身份象徵**的技術功能。總體來說，MEME2.0 正朝「**迷因 + X 技術**」的方向演進，無論是AI、自動做市商(AMM)還是身份協議，都可能成為迷因幣項目的組成部分。這種跨領域融合既增加了代幣的實用性，也豐富了元宇宙的技術圖景，使得娛樂性代幣有機會轉化為Web3生態的一環。

**3. 社群文化與參與模型的驅動**  
沒有社群，就沒有迷因幣；而MEME2.0的發展更深刻地體現了**社群文化**和**參與模式**的力量。在迷因2.0時代，社群早已不滿足於線上喊單、炒作，而是探索更深入的參與和自我驅動模式。首先，**社群創造敘事**變得更加主動。早期迷因幣可能只是開發者創造一個梗丟給市場，但現在許多項目讓社群本身參與到迷因的創造和傳播中。Turbo項目的成功部分歸功於創始人將決策權交給社群：通過在X平台發起投票來決定項目名稱、吉祥物和發展方向，營造出共同創作的氛圍。這種**去中心化參與**使持有者產生強烈的歸屬感和使命感，更願意長期支持項目。其次，**貢獻即收穫的模型**日趨流行。為了激勵社群擴張，不少MEME2.0項目採用空投、任務獎勵、積分排行等機制，鼓勵用戶拉新、創作內容。例如Nad.fun要求用戶在社群媒體上為項目造勢才能獲取積分兌換空投；一些迷因幣還將NFT藝術創作比賽、梗圖大賽作為常態活動，使社群成員不僅是投資者，更是內容生產者。第三，社群開始**走向線下**凝聚共識。BlockBeats報導指出，線下活動能帶來更高的黏性和真實信任，一旦某迷因幣社群積累了足夠多的現實用戶聚會，它將成為交易所爭相上架的對象。因此我們看到一些迷因項目舉辦社區見面會、跨城市宣傳活動，把虛擬的狂熱延伸到現實世界，這實際上呼應了元宇宙所強調的虛實相融。總之，MEME2.0時代的社群文化更加豐富多元：既保留了網路迷因的戲謔精神，又引入了共創、共治的Web3參與模式。在這樣的文化驅動下，一個迷因幣項目若能善用「群體智慧」，便可能從芸芸炒作中脫穎而出，形成難以複製的社群護城河，持續推動項目發展壯大。

# 五、結語

MEME2.0 是區塊鏈領域的一股獨特潮流，它源自迷因文化又超越了迷因本身。在經歷早期迷因幣狂熱與冷卻後，新一代的迷因幣開始融入技術創新和應用場景，試圖證明自己不只是「郁金香泡沫」般的投機遊戲。透過分析我們看到，MEME2.0 背後既有**狂熱的市場機會**——小資本博取暴富神話——也伴隨**殘酷的競爭和風險**。在這場充滿戲謔卻影響深遠的實驗中，勝出的將不再只是運氣，而是那些能結合文化、技術與社群力量的項目。對投資者而言，MEME2.0或許提供了與Web3和元宇宙互動的新入口；對整個加密行業而言，迷因幣的進化則提醒我們：\*\*「讓普通人也有機會參與並一夜暴富」\*\*一直是最有號召力的敘事之一。唯有善用這股力量，並賦予其正向價值導向，才能讓MEME2.0真正成為推動區塊鏈大眾化的助燃劑，而不僅僅是曇花一現的狂歡。今後，隨著Web3技術的成熟，我們有理由相信迷因幣還將繼續演變，或許有朝一日，「Meme3.0」會帶來更令人意想不到的創新與驚喜。

2025-04-16,"Kendu - Restoring Trust in Crypto As the crypto world has been tarnished by celeb rug pulls, political rug pulls, utility rug pulls and just degenerate gambling behaviour in general, Kendu is set to stand out from the crowd. Kendu is not hopping on the next big craze, that will ultimately not last and a lot of people will be exit liquidity, Kendu is building the next multi billion dollar brand. Yes, reading this might sound crazy if you haven’t heard of Kendu’s mission, but I will try and explain it to you today!

 

Kendu is unlike the vast, vast majority of all other memecoins because we have a lot of IRL initiatives, Kendu is currently running a glow in the dark Pickleball tournament in India(shoutout to Ishan), these Pickleball tournaments are attracting a lot of attention and are enforcing the community spirit which is within all Chads/Chadettes. Kendu has also attended 3 Florida festivals in the past 6 months(shoutout to the Kendu Street Team, Inkstradamus, NoSleep305 and whoever else who helped). Last weekend Kendu was at the Florida Groves Festival in Orlando and StaySeaArt created a cool Kendu mural which will be shown below.  
At these Florida festivals, Kendu has been giving out Kendu Energy(energy drinks) and merch. This is obviously giving Kendu a big name within the festival goer community!!!

**Some General Kendu information**: Kendu is an Ethereum native memecoin, but we have bridged to both Solana and Base this year. Kendu’s We Don’t Gamble, We Work slogan perfectly encapsulates the drive, determination and unbreakable will power that the community has. Kendu is totally organic and community led, this means we do not pay any KOLs. At the time of writing this post, Kendu has nearly 18k holders and is sitting at a market cap around 13 million. Kendu has an A rating on Certik and achieved the Certik audit by reaching 50k votes, the only other coin to reach this feat was Pepe!!!  
Certik is a security based company and is very, very reputable within the crypto community, you can this here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)

  
Here is a list of the current Kendu IRL initiatives:



* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far! 
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks. I think it will be available on Steam
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art

 **A question to everyone for the comments, what Kendu products have you tried so far?**

https://preview.redd.it/sb60d30787ve1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3cef7d2565a316a9cd58625399bce010df6c9a8

Let me just say this…. All of these products have been created when the vast majority of Kendu holders are in the red. So, the average person is spending a lot of time and money to take a risk on their own project to help push Kendu forward! Where else can you see something like this?  


Thanks for reading up this point, I will close with some comments and let you get on your way!  
Look at Shiba Inu in 2021 or Pepe, they didn’t have a KOL or anything special, it was just an average coin with an obsessed, relentless community who stopped at nothing to take it to the top. Kendu is no different in terms of relying on the power of an incredible community, however we are bringing to the table a lot more than those coins did, we are arriving with an IRL presence that is **unprecedented.** If you are reading this and you are not a Kendu holder, my advice to you would be to go on Twitter or Reddit and look around, you will see Kendu everywhere. Also, I’d recommend you join our telegram and check out our activity compared to coins that are in the hundreds of millions.  
The goal is simple and the path is clear, Kendu will be one of the top performers this cycle, this is not a coin to ignore….

Gasylix verspricht genau das: smarte Algorithmen, einfache Bedienung und sogar *kommissionsfreies Trading*. Aber was steckt wirklich dahinter?

In diesem Post teile ich meine **Gasylix Erfahrungen** – ehrlich, ausführlich und mit einem kritischen Blick.

**Kurzfazit:** Gasylix ist eine interessante Plattform für Einsteiger und Fortgeschrittene im Krypto-Trading. Besonders die einfache Bedienung und die Möglichkeit, ohne Kommission zu handeln, machen es attraktiv. Kleinere Schwächen gibt’s bei Transparenz und mobilem Zugang.

## Was ist Gasylix?

Gasylix ist eine **automatisierte Trading-Plattform**, die sich auf Kryptowährungen spezialisiert. Sie verspricht, mithilfe von KI und Algorithmen profitable Trades durchzuführen – und das ohne dass du selbst stundenlang Charts analysieren musst. Ideal also für Leute, die keine Zeit oder Lust auf manuelles Trading haben.

Die Plattform richtet sich sowohl an Anfänger als auch an erfahrene Trader. Du kannst entweder selbst aktiv handeln oder den Algorithmus für dich arbeiten lassen. Besonders cool: Es gibt eine **Paper Trading**-Option, mit der du alles risikofrei testen kannst, bevor du echtes Geld einsetzt.

## Wer hat Gasylix entwickelt??

Die genauen Entwickler von Gasylix sind – wie bei vielen dieser Plattformen – nicht öffentlich bekannt. Was wir wissen: Das Team besteht laut eigenen Angaben aus **Krypto-Experten**, **Softwareentwicklern** und **Finanzanalysten**. Einige Quellen deuten darauf hin, dass das System auf ähnlichen Technologien wie bei Bitcoin Code oder Immediate Edge basiert.

Ein bisschen mehr Transparenz wäre hier wünschenswert. Aber immerhin: Die Plattform scheint regelmäßig Updates zu erhalten, was auf ein aktives Entwicklerteam hindeutet.

## Gasylix Vor & Nachteile

**Vorteile:**

- **Kommissionsfreies Trading** – Keine versteckten Gebühren
- **Automatisierter Handel** mit KI-Unterstützung
- **Anfängerfreundliche Oberfläche**
- **Paper Trading** zum Üben ohne Risiko
- **Schnelle Ein- und Auszahlungen**

**Nachteile:**

- **Wenig Transparenz** über das Entwicklerteam
- **Kein offizieller App-Store-Download** (nur Web-App)
- **Mindest-Einzahlung von 250 €** – für manche zu hoch
- **Keine vollständige Kontrolle beim Auto-Trading**

## Wie funktioniert Gasylix?

Gasylix nutzt einen **Algorithmus**, der Marktdaten in Echtzeit analysiert und automatisch Trades ausführt, wenn sich profitable Gelegenheiten ergeben. Das System basiert auf **KI-gestützten Modellen**, die historische Daten auswerten und Vorhersagen treffen.

Du kannst entweder:
- den **Auto-Trading-Modus** aktivieren und das System handeln lassen, oder
- **manuell traden**, wenn du mehr Kontrolle willst.

Besonders nice: Du kannst mit dem **Demokonto** starten und alles risikofrei testen. Sobald du überzeugt bist, kannst du mit echtem Geld loslegen.

## Mit welchen Geräten kann man Gasylix nutzen?

Gasylix läuft komplett **browserbasiert**, also:
- Auf **PCs und Laptops** (Windows, macOS)
- Auf **Tablets**
- Auf **Smartphones** über den Browser

Es gibt noch **keine native App** für iOS oder Android, was etwas schade ist. Aber die Web-Version ist mobilfreundlich und funktioniert auch unterwegs ziemlich gut.

## Gasylix – Top Features

### Paper Trading

Das **Demokonto** ist eines der besten Features von Gasylix. Du bekommst virtuelles Guthaben, um die Plattform zu testen – perfekt für Anfänger oder wenn du eine neue Strategie ausprobieren willst. Keine Risiken, kein Stress.

### Kommissionsloses Trading

Bei Gasylix zahlst du **keine Kommission** auf Trades. Das ist ein echter Pluspunkt, denn bei vielen Plattformen frisst dich die Gebührenstruktur irgendwann auf. Hier bleibt mehr Gewinn bei dir hängen.

### Zugriff auf Top Krypto Assets

Du bekommst Zugriff auf eine ziemlich gute Auswahl an **beliebten Kryptowährungen**, darunter:
- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Litecoin (LTC)
- Ripple (XRP)
- uvm.

Für die meisten Trader reicht das locker aus. Exoten wie Shiba Inu oder Meme-Coins sind allerdings (noch) nicht an Bord.

## Ist Gasylix Betrug oder seriös?

Die große Frage: **Ist das Ding echt oder Abzocke?** Nach meinen Tests und Recherchen sieht es so aus, als wäre Gasylix **seriös** – auch wenn ein paar Punkte wie die fehlenden Entwicklerinfos skeptisch machen.

Was für die Seriosität spricht:
- Die Plattform ist **verschlüsselt** und nutzt SSL
- **Auszahlungen funktionieren** (nach Verifizierung)
- Gute **Kundenbewertungen** auf unabhängigen Seiten

Was kritisch ist:
- **Kein Impressum** auf der Website
- **Keine Info über die Lizenzierung**

Fazit: Kein offensichtlicher Scam, aber mit gesundem Menschenverstand rangehen.

## Was ist Immediate Growth?

Immediate Growth ist eine **automatisierte Krypto-Trading-Plattform**, die mithilfe von Algorithmen den Handel erleichtern soll. Die Idee dahinter ist simpel: Die Software analysiert den Markt, erkennt Trends und führt dann automatisch Trades aus – **ohne dass man ständig vorm Bildschirm hängen muss**.

Das Ziel? Gewinne erzielen, auch wenn man kein Profi ist. Für Anfänger und Gelegenheitstrader klingt das wie ein Jackpot. Aber auch für erfahrene Trader kann das Tool spannend sein – vor allem wegen der **zeitersparenden Automatisierung**. Immediate Growth wirbt damit, dass man kein Vorwissen braucht, um loszulegen. Ehrlich gesagt: Das stimmt teilweise. Denn wer ein bisschen Ahnung mitbringt, holt definitiv mehr raus.

## Wer hat Immediate Growth entwickelt??

Das ist einer der Punkte, die ich kritisch sehe: **Es gibt keine klare Info dazu, wer genau hinter Immediate Growth steckt.** Das ist bei vielen dieser Plattformen der Fall. Angeblich wurde es von einem Team aus erfahrenen Krypto- und FinTech-Experten entwickelt – aber Namen? Fehlanzeige.

Das muss nicht automatisch schlecht sein. Viele legitime Projekte starten anonym. Aber trotzdem wäre es cool, ein Gesicht oder zumindest ein paar verifizierbare Infos zu haben. **Transparenz würde hier auf jeden Fall helfen, Vertrauen zu stärken.**

## Immediate Growth Vor & Nachteile

**Vorteile:**

- ✅ Vollautomatisiertes Trading möglich
- ✅ Kein Vorwissen nötig
- ✅ Kommissionsfrei
- ✅ Unterstützt viele große Coins wie Bitcoin, Ethereum
- ✅ Paper Trading zum Üben
- ✅ Schnell eingerichtet

**Nachteile:**

- ❌ Entwicklerteam bleibt anonym
- ❌ Keine eigene Mobil-App (nur Web-Version)
- ❌ Man braucht Disziplin beim Risikomanagement
- ❌ Kein Zugriff auf exotische Altcoins

## Wie funktioniert Immediate Growth?

Die Plattform nutzt **KI-basierte Algorithmen**, um Marktdaten in Echtzeit zu analysieren. Sobald ein Handelsmuster erkannt wird, führt die Software automatisch einen Trade aus – entweder Kauf oder Verkauf. Dabei wird auf kurzfristige Gewinne spekuliert, ähnlich wie beim Daytrading.

Man kann den Bot entweder **vollautomatisch laufen lassen** oder bestimmte Parameter selbst einstellen, z. B. Stop-Loss-Limits oder Gewinnziele. Das finde ich besonders gut, weil man so ein bisschen Kontrolle behält – auch wenn man den Autopiloten nutzt.

Der Clou: **Die Software ist rund um die Uhr aktiv**, was heißt, dass man auch nachts oder während der Arbeit potentiell Gewinne machen kann. Natürlich ist das kein Garant – der Markt ist volatil – aber es nimmt einem viel Arbeit ab.

## Mit welchen Geräten kann man Immediate Growth nutzen?

Immediate Growth läuft komplett im Webbrowser, also:

- **PC / Laptop** – funktioniert einwandfrei
- **Smartphone** – optimiert für mobile Browser
- **Tablet** – ebenfalls gut nutzbar

Eine **native App gibt es aktuell nicht**, was schade ist. Aber die mobile Website ist gut gestaltet, schnell und einfach zu bedienen. Für unterwegs reicht das locker aus – auch wenn ich mir eine App mit Push-Benachrichtigungen wünschen würde.

## Immediate Growth – Top Features

### Paper Trading

Eines meiner Lieblingsfeatures: **Paper Trading**. Damit kann man den Bot erstmal testen – komplett ohne echtes Geld. Die Plattform simuliert echte Marktbedingungen, sodass man ein Gefühl dafür bekommt, wie sich Trades verhalten würden.

Gerade für Einsteiger ist das Gold wert. Man kann Strategien ausprobieren, ohne Risiko. Auch ich hab das erstmal genutzt, um zu checken, wie sich die Software verhält, bevor ich echtes Geld eingezahlt habe.

### Kommissionsloses Trading

**Keine versteckten Gebühren** – das ist ein echter Pluspunkt. Viele Plattformen kassieren bei jedem Trade mit. Bei Immediate Growth fallen **keine Kommissionen** an. Das heißt natürlich nicht, dass es komplett kostenlos ist – die Plattform verdient wohl an Spreads (also der Differenz zwischen Kauf- und Verkaufspreis).

Aber: Es gibt **keine monatlichen Abos, keine Einrichtungsgebühren**. Das macht den Einstieg sehr angenehm.

### Zugriff auf Top Krypto Assets

Immediate Growth bietet Zugang zu den wichtigsten Kryptowährungen:

- **Bitcoin (BTC)**
- **Ethereum (ETH)**
- **Litecoin (LTC)**
- **Ripple (XRP)**
- **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**

Exotische Coins wie Shiba Inu oder kleinere DeFi-Token sind (noch) nicht dabei, aber ich denke, das ist für die meisten okay. Die Plattform fokussiert sich auf **stabile, liquide Märkte**, was aus Sicht des Algorithmus Sinn macht.

## Ist Immediate Growth Betrug oder seriös?

Ich hab mich intensiv mit dieser Frage beschäftigt. Und mein Fazit: **Immediate Growth wirkt seriös**, auch wenn es ein paar typische Schwächen gibt – wie die anonyme Entwicklerfirma.

Die Plattform funktioniert, Auszahlungen laufen (bei mir) problemlos, und es gibt keine offensichtlichen Red Flags wie bei Scam-Bots. Trotzdem: **Man sollte nie mehr investieren, als man bereit ist zu verlieren.** Das gilt generell für Krypto-Trading, egal ob automatisiert oder manuell.

Einfach die offizielle Seite von Immediate Growth aufrufen. Am besten direkt über einen sicheren Link, den man z. B. hier auf Reddit findet.

Das geht relativ unkompliziert. Einfach:

Ich habe das mit einem Test-Account probiert – hat ein paar Tage gedauert, aber es wurde sauber abgewickelt. Kein Drama.

## Minimale Einzahlung bei Immediate Growth

Die **Mindesteinzahlung beträgt 250 €**. Das ist marktüblich und vergleichbar mit anderen Plattformen wie Bitcoin Era oder Immediate Edge. Für den Start ist das okay – man sollte halt nicht gleich alles reinwerfen.

## Gibt es prominente Unterstützung für Immediate Growth?

**Nein – keine offiziell bestätigte Promi-Unterstützung.** Es kursieren Gerüchte über Elon Musk, Joko Winterscheidt oder Frank Thelen – aber nichts davon ist verifiziert. Solche Gerüchte tauchen ständig auf und sind meistens Quatsch.

Wenn eine Plattform echt gut ist, braucht sie auch keine Fake-Promis. Just saying.

## Immediate Growth – unterstützte Länder

Immediate Growth ist in vielen Ländern verfügbar, u. a.:

- **Deutschland, Österreich, Schweiz**
- **Frankreich, Italien, Spanien**
- **Kanada, Australien**
- **Einige asiatische Länder**

Die USA sind (wie bei vielen Krypto-Plattformen) **nicht dabei**, wegen der strengen Regulierung dort.

## Kundenservice

Der Kundenservice ist **okay, aber nicht überragend**. Es gibt:

- Live-Chat (tagsüber aktiv)
- E-Mail-Support
- Einen persönlichen Ansprechpartner nach Anmeldung

Antworten kamen bei mir meistens innerhalb von 24 Stunden. Verbesserungswürdig: Eine FAQ-Sektion auf der Website wäre nice.

2025-04-15,"Adopted an aggressive biter I recently adopted a 2 year old spayed female shiba inu from a shelter.  I was told about some resource guarding but was not prepared for full out attacking. 

She has now aggressively bitten my husband and myself on several occasions over the past 2 weeks.  Yesterday she attacked my foot (thankly i was wearing leather flats and was not injured) for blocking the screen door and not allowing her back inside the house when we had a workman over.  My husband was outside, i was going out too & we just wanted her out of workmans way.  

She also growls, barks, shows teeth when we try to brush her, even gently.  She's blowing her coat so she needs it.  We can only do it while she is sleeping.  We can't send her to a groomer like this.  She allowed me to give her a bath at the petco self-serve dog wash on day 2 but she was practically a different dog then.

The aggressive behavior has gotten worse during 2 months we have had her.  Initially she would nip and we took her to dog training sessions which was really targeted to basic commands and manners.  We have one on one training starting tomorrow.   

Has anyone been able to successfully train aggression out of thier shiba inu?  Looking for some hopeful stories.  We did get her a muzzle for baths and I am going to reach out to vet about potentially medicating her.  

We have a pre-schooler and his safety is our first priority.  We really don't want to rehome and are concerned that we won't even be able to rehome an aggressive dog.  She can be really sweet and I don't think she is a bad girl but this behavior can't continue.  

Any tips?!?!? I feel terrible",0.03,1,10
2025-04-15,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

I find the interplay of our persistent Short Selling, being moderated by pockets of Buying Sentiment, to be fascinating. It is a true tug-of-war that unwittingly keeps market dynamics within healthy ranges. This is far from a dull Consolidation phase. ""My mission is to kill time, and time’s to kill me in its turn. How comfortable one is among murderers."" Momentum Indicators reveal Oversold conditions, yet the activity from Short Sellers entering the market was counterbalanced by investors Buying the dips. Sellers maintain Weak control of the market across multiple time frames because profit-taking and Short Selling are occurring in tandem. Trend Indicators highlight that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling a Bearish Consolidation phase. Bollinger Bands are contracting sharply, giving an early signal of breakout pressure. ADX values indicate Strong Trend strength while the price remains BELOW the Supertrend and all EMAs. This price level confirms the Bearish side of Consolidation. 

Volatility Indicators support the contraction of the Bollinger Bands as Volatility falls to the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are BELOW the Volatility Bands, signaling a potential reversal benchmark. Volume Indicators continue to show participation that is slowly increasing on a daily basis as investors grab the dips and move more money into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators continue to show Strong levels of accumulation, although at a reduced rate compared to the past few days. This Short term pullback has passed Oversold conditions, and the Short term Trend cycle is emerging negative. This negative Trend cycle was Strong enough to pull the market from its Long term positive position in what I would otherwise consider a Neutral position; however, based on current values, it is technically a Weak negative Trend cycle.

In a way, I appreciate the role of Short Sellers in keeping the market active. It is like rooting for the antiheroes. Their rapid participation exerts pressure on the market in both directions, allowing for a quicker response to dips that retrace to appreciation over Short intervals. This gradual depreciation does not discourage investors. Instead, it encourages dip buying by demonstrating that the market remains active without ‘Price Action’. I do not expect us to reach critical price levels of Support. In the Short term, we will continue to trade BELOW our Indicator Supports until a catalyst emerges and Buyers become more aggressive, at which point a rebound scenario would see prices closing ABOVE Indicator Resistance levels to signal the start of a recovery phase. Until that occurs, expect a continuation of the Consolidation phase.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is currently resting at the TOP of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level pivot point, at $0.00001180. The critical level of Support is more clearly defined today; at LOWEST, the price could reach the BOTTOM of the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 3rd-level pivot point, at $0.00001110. Just a little extra insight: should we breach our critical level, the Oversold crash price is mathematically projected to occur when the 14-Day RSI falls to 30%, at $0.00000870. BELOW this absolute worst case, the price could collapse to $0.00000350 when the 14-Day RSI reaches 20%. At MAX, the price will need to recapture the Long term Neutral major pivot point, which is now located roughly in the same position as the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW, at approximately $0.00001220 to $0.00001230.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

Hat jemand von euch schon [Swap Relpax AI](https://tinyurl.com/bdzkzpk4) ausprobiert? Ich bin kürzlich über diese Plattform gestolpert, als ich nach einer simpleren Möglichkeit gesucht habe, in den Kryptomarkt einzusteigen, ohne mich komplett in stundenlange Charts und Analysen reinfuchsen zu müssen.

Gerade jetzt, wo KI-basierte Trading-Plattformen wie Pilze aus dem Boden schießen – von Bitcoin Code über Immediate Edge bis hin zu Swap Relpax AI – wird es immer schwerer, den Überblick zu behalten. Aber Swap Relpax AI hat mein Interesse geweckt, weil es nicht nur automatische Trades verspricht, sondern das Ganze auch noch angeblich ohne Provisionen und mit Zugang zu Top-Krypto-Assets anbietet.

In diesem Post will ich euch meine Erfahrungen mit Swap Relpax AI schildern. Ich gehe auf alles ein – von der Registrierung über die Funktionen bis hin zu den Vor- und Nachteilen. Wenn ihr also wissen wollt, ob sich der Einstieg lohnt oder ob das Ganze nur heiße Luft ist, dann lest weiter.

## Was ist Swap Relpax AI?

Swap Relpax AI ist eine **automatisierte Krypto-Trading-Plattform**, die sich auf den Einsatz von Künstlicher Intelligenz spezialisiert hat, um profitable Handelsentscheidungen zu treffen. Ziel ist es, sowohl Einsteigern als auch erfahrenen Tradern den Zugang zum Kryptomarkt so einfach wie möglich zu machen – ohne stundenlang Charts analysieren zu müssen.

Die Plattform verspricht, durch den Einsatz moderner Algorithmen den besten Zeitpunkt für Kauf und Verkauf zu erkennen. Das Ganze läuft im Hintergrund ab, sodass man sich auf andere Dinge konzentrieren kann. Besonders hervorzuheben ist, dass Swap Relpax AI **keine Handelsgebühren** verlangt – zumindest keine direkten Kommissionen, was für viele schon ein großer Pluspunkt ist.

### [👉 Starte noch heute mit dem Trading auf Swap Relpax AI](https://tinyurl.com/bdzkzpk4)
## Wer hat Swap Relpax AI entwickelt??

Über die Entwickler hinter Swap Relpax AI ist leider nicht viel bekannt – was in der Welt der Krypto-Trading-Bots nicht unüblich ist. Es wird spekuliert, dass ein Team aus **FinTech- und KI-Experten** hinter dem Projekt steckt, ähnlich wie bei Plattformen wie „Bitcoin Era“ oder „Immediate Edge“.

Obwohl es keine öffentlich einsehbaren Profile oder ein offizielles Team gibt, macht die Plattform auf mich einen soliden Eindruck. Die Benutzeroberfläche ist professionell gestaltet, es gibt eine klare Struktur, und der Support scheint auch zu funktionieren – das ist schon mal mehr, als viele andere Bots auf dem Markt bieten.

## Swap Relpax AI Vor & Nachteile

### Vorteile

- **Automatisiertes Trading**: Kein manuelles Eingreifen nötig  
- **Keine Kommissionen**: Ideal für Trader mit kleinem Budget  
- **Einfache Registrierung**: Konto in wenigen Minuten eröffnet  
- **Paper Trading verfügbar**: Erst testen, dann investieren  
- **Zugang zu vielen Krypto-Assets**: Nicht nur Bitcoin  

### Nachteile

- **Keine offizielle Regulierung**: Das kann für Skeptiker ein Dealbreaker sein  
- **Keine native mobile App**: Nur Web-App, aber immerhin mobil optimiert  
- **Mindesteinzahlung von 250 €**: Für manche vielleicht zu hoch zum Einstieg  
- **Wenig Infos über das Entwicklerteam**: Transparenz könnte besser sein  

## Wie funktioniert Swap Relpax AI?

Die Plattform nutzt **KI-basierte Algorithmen**, um Krypto-Märkte in Echtzeit zu analysieren. Der Bot erkennt dabei Muster, Preisbewegungen und Marktstimmungen, um automatisch Kauf- oder Verkaufssignale auszuführen. Der Nutzer kann entscheiden, ob er den Bot im **vollautomatischen Modus** laufen lässt oder lieber manuell eingreift.

Besonders cool finde ich, dass man sich nicht vorher stundenlang mit Charts und Candlestick-Formationen beschäftigen muss. Swap Relpax AI nimmt einem diesen Part ab – und das sogar mit anpassbaren Risikoeinstellungen. Für Einsteiger ist das goldwert.

## Mit welchen Geräten kann man Swap Relpax AI nutzen?

Swap Relpax AI läuft vollständig im Browser. Das heißt, ihr könnt die Plattform auf **PC, Laptop, Smartphone oder Tablet** nutzen – ganz ohne Installation. Ich hab’s sowohl auf meinem MacBook als auch auf dem iPhone getestet, und es lief beides mal flüssig.

Auch wenn es keine native App im App Store oder Google Play gibt, ist die Webseite **mobil optimiert**. Ihr könnt also von unterwegs aus eure Trades checken oder den Bot pausieren. Für mich reicht das völlig aus – solange es stabil läuft, brauche ich keine App.

## Swap Relpax AI – Top Features

### Paper Trading

Für mich eins der wichtigsten Features: **Paper Trading**. Damit kann man die Plattform im Demo-Modus testen, ohne echtes Geld zu riskieren. Gerade wenn man neu im Kryptohandel ist oder die Funktionsweise von Swap Relpax AI erstmal verstehen will, ist das super hilfreich.

Man bekommt ein virtuelles Guthaben und kann damit in Echtzeit handeln, als wäre es echtes Geld – nur eben ganz ohne Risiko. Ich hab damit erstmal ein paar Tage rumprobiert, bevor ich wirklich Geld eingezahlt habe.

### Kommissionsloses Trading

Es gibt **keine Handelsgebühren**. Das heißt: Ihr zahlt keine Kommissionen pro Trade, was bei anderen Plattformen gerne mal 1–2 % ausmachen kann. Natürlich verdient Swap Relpax AI vermutlich über den Spread, aber das ist bei fast allen Trading-Plattformen Standard.

Gerade wenn man viel handelt oder kleine Gewinne mitnehmen will, ist das ein echter Vorteil. Weniger Gebühren = mehr Gewinn.

### Zugriff auf Top Krypto Assets

Swap Relpax AI bietet Zugang zu den **beliebtesten Kryptowährungen**, darunter:

- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Litecoin (LTC)
- Ripple (XRP)
- Cardano (ADA)

Obwohl Token wie Dogecoin oder Shiba Inu (noch) fehlen, ist das Portfolio für die meisten Einsteiger und Fortgeschrittenen mehr als ausreichend.

## Ist Swap Relpax AI Betrug oder seriös?

Die Frage aller Fragen. Nach meinem Test würde ich sagen: **Swap Relpax AI wirkt seriös**, auch wenn es keine offizielle Lizenz gibt. Die Plattform funktioniert, Ein- und Auszahlungen haben bei mir geklappt, und der Support antwortet innerhalb von 24 Stunden.

Aber: Es ist immer Vorsicht geboten bei **nicht regulierten Plattformen**. Wer ganz auf Nummer sicher gehen will, sollte sich bei lizenzierten Anbietern wie eToro oder Bitpanda umsehen. Für alle anderen bietet Swap Relpax AI eine spannende Alternative mit hoher Benutzerfreundlichkeit.

2025-04-15,"BTC Wochensparplan, welche Plattform? 
Servus Leute,

ich bin seit Jahren in Aktien investiert und habe demnach auch viel Erfahrung und das nötige know how. 
Mit Krypto hingegen kenne ich mich leider gar nicht aus. Vor einigen Jahren hatte ich mal auf Shitcoins gesetzt (Shiba Inu, Doge, Mana und Vechain) allesamt mit Verlust verkauft, bis auf Shiba das dürfte noch im Plus gewesen sein.

Meine eigentliche Frage: 
BTC, lohnt es sich einen wöchentlichen Sparplan zu erstellen? Würde die erste Zeit um reinzukommen kleine Beträge besparen. 
Habe ein Wallet bei BitPanda für Krypto. Fühle mich da aber nicht wohl, die App ist für mich ein wenig komisch aufgebaut. Gibt es Vorschläge von eurer Seite, über welche Plattform ich investieren sollte? 
Via TR möchte ich nicht da ich mein Aktiendepot nicht mit BTC vermischen möchte, sehe BTC als „Projekt“ und das möchte ich eben allein stehend haben. Außerdem sind auf TR die Satoshis nicht mir, ihr kennt das Thema ja. 

Also, Vorschläge sind sehr gerne willkommen. Ich danke euch jetzt schon 🙏",0.0,2,10

## Was ist Instant 9000 Chantix?

Instant 9000 Chantix ist eine **automatisierte Krypto-Trading-Plattform**, die dir helfen soll, mit möglichst wenig Aufwand in Kryptowährungen zu investieren. Die Plattform nutzt angeblich einen Algorithmus, der Marktdaten in Echtzeit analysiert und dann selbstständig Trades ausführt – alles, um Gewinne zu maximieren.

Das Ziel ist klar: **Einfacher Zugang zum Kryptomarkt**, auch für Leute, die keine Ahnung von Charts, Candlesticks oder technischer Analyse haben. Laut Plattform brauchst du kein Vorwissen – du registrierst dich, zahlst ein, aktivierst den Bot und der Rest läuft (fast) von allein. Das klingt erstmal verlockend, oder?

### [👉 Starte noch heute mit dem Trading auf Instant 9000 Chantix](https://tinyurl.com/49nsw5mr)
## Wer hat Instant 9000 Chantix entwickelt??

Hier wird’s ein bisschen vage: Die Entwickler von Instant 9000 Chantix treten nicht öffentlich auf. Laut Website handelt es sich um ein Team aus **Finanz- und Technologieexperten**, die angeblich jahrelange Erfahrung im Bereich Trading und Künstliche Intelligenz haben. 

Ich hab keine konkreten Namen oder LinkedIn-Profile gefunden, was natürlich ein bisschen schade ist – **Transparenz geht anders**. Andererseits ist das in der Krypto-Welt (leider) nicht unüblich. Solange die Plattform funktioniert und sicher ist, kann ich damit leben – aber ein kleiner Background-Check wäre trotzdem nett gewesen.

## Instant 9000 Chantix Vor & Nachteile

Wie bei jeder Plattform gibt’s auch hier Licht und Schatten. Hier mal meine persönliche Liste nach ein paar Wochen Nutzung:

**Vorteile:**
- **Automatisiertes Trading** – läuft auch während du schläfst
- **Kostenlos nutzbar** – keine versteckten Gebühren
- **Demo-Konto verfügbar** – perfekt zum Üben
- **Benutzerfreundliches Interface** – auch für blutige Anfänger kein Problem
- **Schnelle Registrierung** – in unter 5 Minuten startklar

**Nachteile:**
- **Keine Infos zu den Entwicklern** – wenig Transparenz
- **Kein eigenes Mobile App** – nur über Browser nutzbar
- **Marktrisiken bleiben** – auch der beste Bot liegt mal daneben

## Wie funktioniert Instant 9000 Chantix?

Der Kern von Instant 9000 Chantix ist ein **KI-gestützter Algorithmus**, der Marktbewegungen analysiert und automatisch Trades durchführt. Du gibst grundlegende Parameter wie Risikoniveau oder Investitionshöhe ein, und der Bot übernimmt ab da.

Dabei nutzt er historische Daten, aktuelle Markttrends und sogar Social-Media-Stimmungen (angeblich), um gute Einstiegs- und Ausstiegspunkte zu finden. Klingt komplex, läuft aber im Hintergrund – du musst also **nicht aktiv traden**, wenn du nicht willst. Echt praktisch für Leute mit wenig Zeit oder Erfahrung.

## Mit welchen Geräten kann man Instant 9000 Chantix nutzen?

Die Plattform ist **browserbasiert**, also brauchst du keine Software oder App herunterzuladen. Ich hab’s auf meinem Laptop, Tablet und Smartphone ausprobiert – läuft überall stabil.

Einziger Wermutstropfen: Es gibt **keine dedizierte App**. Klar, die mobile Website funktioniert gut, aber wer gerne alles mit einem Fingertipp öffnet, wird das vielleicht vermissen. Trotzdem: Für unterwegs reicht die Browser-Version locker aus.

## Instant 9000 Chantix – Top Features

### Paper Trading

Das **Demo-Konto** aka Paper Trading ist ein echtes Highlight. Du kannst mit Spielgeld traden und die Plattform risikofrei testen. Gerade als Anfänger ist das Gold wert – du lernst, wie der Bot funktioniert, ohne echtes Geld zu verlieren.

Ich hab das zwei Tage lang genutzt, bevor ich echtes Geld eingezahlt hab – war super zum Üben und Vertrauen aufbauen.

### Kommissionsloses Trading

Viele Plattformen verlangen saftige Gebühren – nicht so bei Instant 9000 Chantix. **Es fallen keine Kommissionen auf Trades an**, was deine Rendite natürlich verbessert. Du zahlst nur die Spreads, also die Differenz zwischen Kauf- und Verkaufspreis – wie bei fast allen Brokern.

Das macht die Plattform auch für **kleine Investitionen** attraktiv. Keine Gebührenfalle – endlich mal was Fairness zeigt.

### Zugriff auf Top Krypto Assets

Du kannst mit mehreren **großen Coins** handeln: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple und ein paar mehr. Keine 100+ Altcoins, aber dafür fokussiert auf die **Top Assets**, was für Einsteiger sicherer ist.

Für mich war das mehr als ausreichend. Wer unbedingt Shiba Inu oder Dogecoin handeln will, muss sich woanders umsehen.

## Ist Instant 9000 Chantix Betrug oder seriös?

Ich war anfangs skeptisch – ist ja bei Krypto-Bots fast Pflicht. Aber nach meiner Testphase würde ich sagen: **Instant 9000 Chantix wirkt seriös**. Die Plattform verwendet SSL-Verschlüsselung, arbeitet mit regulierten Brokern zusammen und hat bei Ein- und Auszahlungen keine Mätzchen gemacht.

Natürlich gibt’s keine Garantie für Gewinne – aber das ist bei jeder Form von Trading so. Solange man mit gesundem Menschenverstand rangeht, sehe ich keinen Grund zur Sorge.

## Gibt es prominente Unterstützung für Instant 9000 Chantix?

Ich hab keine **offiziellen Prominenten** gefunden, die Instant 9000 Chantix unterstützen. Manche Artikel behaupten, dass bekannte Investoren oder TV-Sendungen wie „Die Höhle der Löwen“ dabei waren – aber das ist Quatsch. Solche Behauptungen sind oft reine Werbung.

2025-04-14,"SHIB Daily Projection: Monday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

There is an interesting scenario developing in the charts where the current market is testing an extended Neutral range during a Consolidation phase. Essentially, what we are seeing is that the calm before the storm remains in place. However, underneath are some intriguing market dynamics that will be covered through the various Indicator Classes. Momentum Indicators show that Neutral ground has developed. Buyers did not exit the market; instead, pressure from profit-taking increased over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, which confirms the Consolidation phase. An interesting observation is that the Bollinger Bands are roughly in the same position as they were over the past two days but are expanding at a rate of 1 value per day. This pace does not invalidate breakout potential; rather, it signals Consolidation. ADX values still show elevated Short term Trend strength. Although I classify this as a Bearish condition, it is weakening because the pressure is not Strong Sell pressure. The price has fallen BELOW the Supertrend and our Short term EMAs but remains ABOVE the 200-Day EMA, indicating a resilient yet Weak ‘Price Action’.

Volatility Indicators support the Bollinger Band expansion since Volatility has entered the Neutral of our norms range. Price movements continuing to stay WITHIN the Volatility Bands further confirm Consolidation. Volume Indicators highlight a small increase in participation over both the Short and Long term, while money flow is slowly increasing from Oversold levels. In fact, more money continues to steadily flow into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators reveal continuing Strong accumulation. The Trend for the Short term is emerging as a very Weak positive cycle that remains near Neutral. Despite this Consolidation, a small increase was added to the Long term positive Trend cycle, as evidenced by the increased PVT value. News articles continue to use technical analysis to highlight critical potential breakout areas and cover the rising burn rates. This increasingly Bullish Long term narrative emphasizes positive ecosystem updates and analyst projections that favor price appreciation and recovery. Despite the overwhelmingly positive coverage, these articles also present a balanced outlook by addressing Resistance levels and investor pain points as negative nuances of Volatility. Such insights help offset FUD/FOMO. 

Overall, these Indicators are encouraging. The main takeaway is that an external catalyst tends to drive inherently volatile markets. If an external event occurs that stimulates investor confidence in a broader context, the price will explode in appreciation from its current levels. This is especially notable given how stable the market has been and how resilient it has remained in the face of declines. I do not wish to put my foot in my mouth, but there has been a healthy underlying resiliency that is valuable in its own right. At some point, we will have to break out of this Consolidation phase, yet it is hard to tell when and in which direction we will move, given how long we have held sideways ‘Price Action’. The charts show a wait-and-see phase continuing into medium time frames, meaning that the market could go in either direction based on either an external catalyst or an internal catalyst such as whale movements, which could cause either a breakout or a breakdown. Earlier, a patron remarked that “Nothing” is happening, and that is a good way to put it because nothing appears to be happening on the surface while so much is occurring underneath.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is AT the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210, which lies WITHIN the Neutral range between the ‘Wall of Support’ and the ‘Wall of Resistance’. This further supports the Consolidation outlook. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow the 4-Week retracement levels, with our first test being just below the ‘Wall of Resistance’ at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. The next level above this would be the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price is already near its LOWEST Support levels in the Long term, and this ‘Wall of Support’ is well defined. Falling WITHIN it is not unlikely, and doing so would likely lead to an immediate reversal because these levels are considered attractive dip prices. If I calculate this mathematically, then the LOWEST BOTTOM price before reaching a CRITICAL level would occur where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic Indicators converge at 20%, at $0.00001140.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

## New Band!

[**Criticrista**](https://i.imgur.com/4cETB87.jpeg)

Your classic anime idols quartet made up of cutesy middle schoolers. They doodle hearts on everything, they have inappropriately short miniskirts for their age, they call their fans onii-san/onee-san... exactly what you'd expect from the premise. Same deal with their music: tons of cutesy idol-esque songs about hearts and being cute.

Though what does make them fun to watch is how their leader Rosia (Rina Hidaka), is a sarcastic and Machiavellian bitch off-camera. Also keep an eye on Tsukino, the blue-haired one. She's a sentient teddy bear who plays keytar who is 99% of the time either eating or thinking about food.

I have no idea what's up with their playing cards' suit iconography. As far as I know, no *Show by Rock!!* media has ever elaborated on it.

Interesting bit of trivia: this is the only band we will see in season 1 that isn't one of the original 15 bands that were in the gacha game right when it started in 2012. In fact, Criticrista was only announced and added to the game the month before the anime started airing.

&nbsp;

[**Uwasanopetals**](https://i.imgur.com/21XXe9N.jpeg)

These 4 high schooler myumons who cameo'd at the end of the episode are Uwasanopetals. They're *Show by Rock!!*'s equivalent of the *K-On!*-esque high school music club trope. They're stuck at a rural high school way out in the countryside, with dreams of making it big in the city after they graduate.

Musical style-wise, yeah they're pretty much what you'd expect from ""anime high school band"". Very ""light music club"" J-pop sort of style.

Shibarin, the doggirl (yes, specifically a shiba inu) is the band's leader and the sole vocalist - the others don't even do backup vocals. The one with the pigtails is their pianist, Pokoe, and despite what the green skin she has in myumon form would make you think, no she's not a froggirl or a kappa, [she's a tanukigirl](https://i.imgur.com/I3PThKK.png), which is awesome.

Shibarin's vocals were originally performed by the singer LUNA (Haruna Takiguchi), but that was only for their first 3 songs and for one reason or another she was recast with Marika Kōno (from Seiyu's Life/Earphones; Team Ohenro; Suzuka in Uma Musume) around the time of the anime.

Perhaps because of complications surrounding that change of performer (or not, who knows) this is the first (but not the last) band we will meet in the anime who never actually have any of their songs played in the anime, so check out the Bonus Songs section for a taste of them!

2025-04-14,"Puppy developing weird behaviors as she hits 6 months old! Hello everyone! Meet Miko. She is a 6 months old Shiba Inu puppy. We welcomed her in January to our home where my husband, our other dog Rufus (3 yrs old, M) and I lived in. Since she came, Rufus and Miko got along so well though I had to ensure Rufus that she won’t take his food (prevent resource guarding) and always intervened when he was rough with her or vice versa. She loved cuddling with him and she never showed any signs of weird behaviors until last week. 

We crate train her, so we have one crate downstairs where we feed her and another crate upstairs in our bedroom where she sleeps in. We started observing two behavior changes:

1. She usually loves following Rufus around and cuddling with him on the couch. She is all of sudden distant to him, and she now rests in her crate alone when Rufus is resting on the couch. 
2. We gave her a puzzle to solve with kibbles and few high value treats inside. She solved a few but did not pick out all treats that night. The next AM, Rufus was playing with it (it WAS/IS his too). She started growling and staring at him. They did a stare match for a bit and she lunged at him. He did not get bit but we separated them immediately and took the puzzle away. Then few hours later, it happened again as I was loading the dishes to the dishwasher. Miko tried to lick some leftover food while I wasn’t looking and Rufus was near. She started growling and snapping. I took her away. 

Now I am spiraling. Would really appreciate it if you share good resource guard training resources that worked for you and encouraging words from pet parents who got through similar issues. 

I read somewhere as a female pup approaches heat, this could happen but doesn’t mean it will go away when she is done with heat or she is spayed. 

Fyi, we both have not noticed any weird changes in Rufus at all or the way he plays/interacts with her. ",-0.029663461538461538,1,4

2025-04-13,"SHIB Daily Projection: Sunday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

The market held through a Consolidation phase and I will admit I was a little worried because I did not know how new investors would react. It seems that profit-taking in the Short term did not trigger a larger sell off; instead, it helped encourage some dip buying. Those who sold did so at a modest rate, leaving runners in the market and acting with the wisdom to protect their Short term capital gains. Momentum Indicators show that the Weak pull back was enough to drive the market into very Short term Oversold territory while leaving Buyers in Weak control over multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is AT the HIGH Band of the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands hold steady with breakout pressure. ADX values confirm that the sharp Downtrend has already expressed its MAX strength, resulting in a Short term dip that was sufficient to bring the price BELOW the Supertrend and the 12-Day EMA. Despite this Short term pull back caused by profit-taking, the market remains ABOVE the Long term EMAs, verifying that ‘Price Action’ continues to be valid. Volatility Indicators support the ongoing outlook for breakout pressure as evidenced by the contraction of the Bollinger Bands. Volatility has declined and is holding at the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, confirming the Consolidation phase and supporting an outlook of breakout pressure. 

Volume Indicators signal a modest level of participation through the dips, which was an encouraging sign. Money flow indicates a Short term Oversold benchmark through the dip as increased money flows into the market compared to how much is leaving. Sentiment Indicators highlight Stronger levels of accumulation, while the CCI reflects the strength of the dip as a negative bump in a Longer term positive Trend cycle that is gaining strength, as seen by rising PVT values. News articles indicate that whales and retail investors are strategically accumulating while confirming the Bullish narrative with technical signals such as ‘Golden Crosses’ and Resistance prices that set the stage for a Bullish breakout if the Support holds as expected. The Long term optimism is tempered with Short term cautions regarding Volatility due to many holders experiencing losses and a declining market ranking. However, these reports also outline a path for recovery rather than doom and gloom. As usual, the News does an excellent job of alleviating FUD/FOMO.

Overall, the breakout potential has not been invalidated by the current resilient Indicator values, although they do confirm the Short term Volatility of this asset class. Given the market's resiliency and investors reaction to the pull back that led to Consolidation, the market will continue to Consolidate as a way of gauging Short term direction. It will also continue to build Buy pressure in an Uptrend cycle to test higher Resistance levels.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price remains ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210. The analysis confirms that the market is following the 4-Week retracement levels and is currently resting at the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230, which acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. This is a healthy Neutral range while Buy pressure is building. At MAX, the price will reach up to test the ‘Wall of Resistance’ at the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290. At LOWEST, the price will pull back to test the ‘Wall of Support’ at the 1st-level Support pivot point at $0.00001180.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-13,"🚨 Bitcoin Analyst Says Shiba Inu Price Is Not Hitting $1 – Here’s Why If you're hoping for Shiba Inu to hit that elusive $1 mark, hold on to your hats! A fresh analysis from the ever-watchful Bitcoin analyst Davinci Jeremie has sent the community into a frenzy. 🚀 With a massive circulating supply of about 589.5 trillion SHIB tokens, reaching that magic price point feels like chasing shadows. 

Jeremie argues that for Shiba Inu to reach $1, its market cap would need to balloon to a jaw-dropping $600 trillion. To put that in perspective, think of Bitcoin's current market cap at around $1.66 trillion – that's nearly 600 times more! Even gold, which has a market cap of roughly $21.857 trillion, would look tiny next to SHIB's lofty aspirations. 😲

Community reactions are mixed, with many echoing the sentiment that reaching $1 is a far-fetched dream. Some think that reducing the supply through token burns might help, but with over 410.7 trillion SHIB already burnt, the circulating supply still looms large. 🐕

In a world where possibility meets realism, the road ahead for SHIB remains uncertain. Keep watch and stay informed as the crypto landscape evolves!

However, the big boss run was horrible and super challenging. It was so agonizing to do the same part over and over again and I believe I have memorized the whole game after having to retry so much. The worst parts for me would have to be the fatman fight, managed to do it alright in the beginning but would always fail on the section afterwards, and after a while the fatman fight itself really started to terrorize me with some of his random movements. By far the worst part would have to be the harrier, Even though i memorized the order of attacks I still had to retry multiple times, and when i finally did it the rest of the game was a lot easier.

2025-04-13,Shiba inu My 6 year old male Shiba Inu is having issues with his ears. He keeps scratching at them. Thought maybe it was food allergies but I changed his food and there has been no change. I looked inside his ear to see if I could identify anything off like ear mites but nothing. I gently clean his ears and the ear wipes always come out with ear wax. It gets worse at night to the point that he is grinding his teeth while itching. I also started him on some over the counter allergy meds about a week ago now. I noticed that the left side of his face seems a little swollen as well but I'm not sure if it's just from the itching.,-0.052976190476190475,1,0

2025-04-12,"SHIB Daily Projection: Saturday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

These charts are quite calm in spite of the renewed Buyer interest. The activity is not overwhelming, which implies a healthy level of stability in the current market. Momentum Indicators reveal that Buy pressure has strengthened in the Short term, reaching an Overbought benchmark. Buyers hold an Average level of control over the market across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators show that price movements are hovering near the HIGH Band of the Ichimoku Cloud while still remaining WITHIN it, which indicates Bullish Consolidation. Bollinger Bands are contracting even further, implying that despite the market being Overbought, breakout pressure is building. The price is positioned ABOVE our Supertrend and all EMAs, while the Short term EMAs are rising ABOVE the Long term EMAs. This suggests a Strong level of ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the contraction of the Bollinger Bands as Volatility has declined to the LOW end of our norms range. Price movements are building near the HIGH Volatility Bands, supporting an outlook of Bullish Consolidation that is building toward a breakout.

Volume Indicators reveal reduced investor participation in both the Short and Long term, as if indicating a calm before the storm. Despite this reduced participation, current money flow shows more money moving into the market, which lends strength to the stable Uptrend during Consolidation. The market remains in a Long term Weak Bearish Neutral position, with plenty of room before conditions become truly Overbought or Oversold. Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong levels of accumulation with additional strength building toward an emerging positive Trend cycle. However, underlying profit-taking forces the market to persist through a Long term negative Trend cycle, as evidenced by declining PVT values. News articles offer a Long term Bullish bias with narratives based on technical analysis that confirm Support and Resistance levels as predictors of price appreciation. Additional positive insights regarding ecosystem developments and updates from developers further illustrate the utilization narrative. Although Short term cautions about Volatility persist, the articles continue to alleviate FUD/FOMO.

Due to the inherent stability observed in the Indicators and the growing positive bias among institutional investors, the Short term price dynamic would be to continue a Bullish Consolidation while building to a point that may trigger a Volatile breakout. Some caution remains, but overall the Indicators and general Sentiment imply continued Uptrend.

Long term Support and Resistances show that we are currently resting AT our Short term Neutral major pivot point, which is just ABOVE the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. This position falls WITHIN the Neutral range ABOVE the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001210, confirming Bullish Consolidation. At MAX, the price will follow the 4-Week retracement path and test the 50% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH/LOW at $0.00001290 as a way to test the ‘Wall of Resistance’. If investor confidence increases, the breakout would extend further, reaching the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. This would extend the range from the very Short term into the Mid term. At LOWEST, the price will pull back and then bounce off the ‘Wall of Support’. The mathematically critical price level is at $0.00001140, where the 3-Day and 14-Day raw stochastic Indicators converge at 20%.

**Why:** The launch of Shibarium (its own L2 blockchain) has expanded SHIBA’s DeFi and NFT capabilities. With enhanced token burn mechanics and active community development, SHIBA is transforming into the ""Ethereum of meme coins.""

# 🛸 Qwadrox (QWRX)

# Forecast: $0.0003 — $0.002



**Why:**  


**Starting price in 2025:** $0.000003206  


* Qwadrox stands out thanks to its **social utility**: the project supports homeless animals and shelters, with real charitable actions backed by the token’s success. 
* Its official site [qwadrox.fun](http://qwadrox.fun) has become a Web3 hub for kindness, gamified tools, and community engagement. 
* It’s still under the radar for many investors, giving it major upside potential as awareness grows. 
* Viral marketing and a supportive online community make Qwadrox one of the most promising underdogs.

# 🐸 Pepe (PEPE)

# Forecast: $0.000002 — $0.000005



**Why:** PEPE continues to ride the wave of meme relevance. It’s a favorite among traders for volatility and has a strong NFT presence. The Pepe community treats it as more than a joke — it’s a symbol of decentralized expression.

# 🇺🇸 Trump (TRUMP)

# Forecast: $5 — $15

**Why:** Political hype fuels speculation. With Trump likely returning to the 2028 race, this token’s activity directly correlates with news cycles, debates, and social movements.

# 🦴 Bonk (BONK)

# Forecast: $0.00002 — $0.00007

**Why:** Bonk is tightly integrated with the Solana ecosystem and often used in NFT-based games. It has large-scale airdrops and massive community support.

# 💨 Fartcoin (FART)

# Forecast: $0.00001 — $0.0001

**Why:** Humor sells — and fartcoin is pure absurdist marketing gold. Its shock value, meme-appeal, and social media virality fuel short bursts of hype and speculative gains.

# 🐺 Floki (FLOKI)

# Forecast: $0.0002 — $0.0005

**Why:** FLOKI invests heavily in marketing, partners with global brands (including football clubs), and is building its own metaverse (Valhalla). The community is strong and growing.

# 💹 SPX6900

# Forecast: $69 — $690

**Why:** A mix of meme magic and WallStreetBets energy, SPX6900 combines finance humor with trader culture. Its appeal is similar to GME and AMC, but tokenized and turbocharged.

# 🐶 WIF (dogwifhat)

# Forecast: $2 — $4

**Why:** WIF thrives on Solana's momentum. Its visual identity (a dog in a hat) and meme strength attract younger investors and meme lovers alike. One of the hottest tokens of 2025, with staying power.

# 🐧 Pengu (PENGU)

# Forecast: $0.003 — $0.01

**Why:** Cute + NFT-friendly + community-driven. Pengu’s mini-games and meme appeal give it strong organic growth. Think of it as the ""penguin version"" of Doge.

# 🧑‍💼 Brett (BRETT)

# Forecast: $0.01 — $0.03

**Why:** Brett is a meme-trader character, popularized on Reddit. It’s especially appealing to Gen Z traders and meme artists. High relatability = high engagement.

# 🐶 Cheems (CHEEMS)

# Forecast: $0.0005 — $0.001

**Why:** A classic in the meme world. Often seen in collabs with DOGE and SHIBA, Cheems continues to resonate due to its lovable and familiar humor.

# 👩 Melania (MELANIA)

# Forecast: $1 — $3

**Why:** Part of the political meme token family. Melania attracts attention as a symbol of crypto feminism and fashion NFTs. It rides the same waves as TRUMP but has its own niche.

# 🐱 Popcat (POPCAT)

# Forecast: $0.01 — $0.07

**Why:** TikTok, Twitch, and YouTube love the clapping cat. POPCAT has transcended meme status and is becoming an internet icon in its own right — with massive community-generated content.

# 🐾 MEW

# Forecast: $0.002 — $0.01

**Why:** The next wave of ""cat tokens"" is emerging. MEW blends nostalgia with modern virality, and it has strong support from NFT projects and mini-games with social causes.



# 🧠 Final Thought:

The meme coin space is no longer a joke. It’s a multibillion-dollar cultural and social economy powered by humor, digital identity, and community values. As we enter 2026, tokens with strong narratives, real-world action (like Qwadrox), and highly engaged users will dominate.

2025-04-12,"🚨 Dogecoin Positioned To Dominate As Asset Manager’s Deep Dive Shows Major Potential In a world where memes reign supreme, Dogecoin (DOGE) is proving it's more than just a joke. Once laughed off as a playful internet fad, the Shiba Inu icon is now strutting its stuff as a heavyweight in the crypto arena. 🚀

21Shares, a leading asset manager, has dropped a bombshell report revealing DOGE’s incredible journey from meme magic to a $30 billion titan. Who knew that a coin with a comical canine would achieve such astronomical returns, soaring 130,000% over the last decade? Talk about a rags-to-riches story! 🎉

What sets Dogecoin apart from other intrications is its community, an emotional tapestry woven from passion and loyalty. This isn't just a crypto asset; it's a cultural phenomenon that embodies the very spirit of the internet. Memes may be fleeting, but DOGE has captured the hearts of millions, proving that sometimes the most unassuming players make the biggest waves. 🌊

As millions of wallet addresses spring up like daisies, the meme coin is embracing mainstream recognition faster than you can say ""to the moon."" With low-cost transactions and the backing of a die-hard fanbase, Dogecoin isn't barking up the wrong tree; it's on a steady path to disrupt finance as we know it. 🐕💰

Will we see DOGE lead the charge in the next altseason? Your guess is as good as ours, but one thing is for sure—the future looks pawsitively promising for this digital dog!

Hopefully local around LA county. I would like to make a new friend or find a nice fun girlfriend to love. I understand it takes time to find the right person, but I am hopeful.

I’m an Armenian guy who loves great food, music, and good company. I’m into grilling, exploring my Armenian roots, and diving into Japanese culture. My free time often includes video games, movies and classic TV shows. Favorites include Skyrim, Dr. Stone, Midnight Diner, Night Court, and MASH*. I just started watching Kojak and I am loving it baby.

 I would like someone I can play board games with, for example Risk and Monopoly are collecting dust in my closet. Always wanted to play super fight or cards against humanity . 

I love penguins but my favorite dog is a Shiba Inu. I have a soft spot for anime and retro music. If you’re someone who enjoys fun/silly conversations, laughing over a good board game, or sharing a delicious meal, we might just hit it off.

Bonus points if you’re adventurous, enjoy trying new foods, or have similar interests. Let’s connect and see where this journey takes us, baby.

2025-04-11,"SHIB Daily Projection: Friday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

As positive Buy energy picks up, the market environment demonstrates the stability needed to nurture Long term recovery within a tight trading range that appears as Consolidations through Short spans. Momentum Indicators signal that Buyers are contending with Sell pressure in the form of profit-taking, which leads to a Weak Bullish rate of change over multiple time frames. Buyers currently hold Average levels of control over the market with plenty of room before reaching Overbought conditions.Trend Indicators show that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud while Bollinger Bands are beginning to contract again, implying a building breakout potential for the market. ADX values confirm Average Trend strength while the price remains ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, highlighting active ‘Price Action’ throughout the current market. Volatility Indicators support the contraction of the Bollinger Bands as Volatility falls to the Neutral of our norms range. Volatility Bands show that price movements are near the HIGH Bands and are attempting to break ABOVE, which supports an outlook of appreciation.

Volume Indicators clarify the Buyers' struggle against Seller outflows resulting from profit-taking by revealing reduced levels of Short and Long term participation. Although there is stable Sell pressure from profit-taking, more money has begun flowing into the market than out. Sentiment Indicators highlight the continued strengthening of the emerging positive Trend cycle with Strong levels of accumulation that have weakened the PVT value and nearly neutralized the Long term negative Trend cycle. This can be considered roughly a Neutral ground. News articles offered a renewed Bullish, Long term narrative for the ecosystem by highlighting the anticipation of upcoming upgrades. This positive narrative shift implies that institutional recognition of Shiba Inu is evolving from a mere MEME to a broader ecosystem of utility. Articles highlight the same Short term Volatility struggles using technical analysis, yet overall they continue to alleviate FUD/FOMO. 

I am reminded of the ‘Group A/Group B’ analogy that I have referred to in the past, as incoming investors are not as accustomed to the current price levels and market behavior. It is with this underlying potential Volatility that I expect the market to continue its Bullish Trend in order to test higher resistance prices before undergoing a minor Consolidation of gains. The breakout potential is building, but even more importantly, there is a broader need for stability and recovery. I implore whale investors to take it lightly on incoming Buyers because their psychology will require stability; otherwise, you risk triggering the emotional side of that ‘Group B’, which can result in an immediate Strong pullback from which their conservative/safe investors may never return.

Long term Support and Resistances show that the price is resting just BELOW the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW, which serves as the Short term Neutral major pivot point, at $0.00001230. At MAX, the price will follow this retracement path to test the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. At LOWEST, the price will test the ‘Wall of Support’, beginning at the 1st-level pivot point at $0.00001140. Falling to the ‘Wall of Support’ would not be significant, but falling BELOW the entire ‘Wall of Support’, specifically BELOW the 3rd standard price deviation at $0.00001060, would classify as a critical point.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-11,"🚨 Trending Meme Coin FARTCOIN Explodes by 260% Monthly: Key Drivers Behind the Surge Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) has taken the crypto world by storm, experiencing a staggering 260% surge in the past month, and currently trading at around $0.87. This meme coin, which launched last October, has now achieved a market capitalization exceeding $860 million, solidifying its position as the 89th largest cryptocurrency on the market. 

The recent rally can be attributed to several factors, including newfound backing from major crypto exchanges like KuCoin and Crypto.com, which have officially listed FARTCOIN trading pairs. However, it’s noteworthy that the token is still not available on leading exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. If these platforms decide to list FARTCOIN, it could drastically enhance its liquidity and potentially trigger another price spike.

Community engagement has also played a critical role in this impressive rise. With a growing number of supporters and endorsements from various crypto influencers, FARTCOIN is gaining significant traction in the meme coin sector. Recent data from LunarCrush indicates that FARTCOIN has recorded the highest social and market activity among its peers, garnering a robust community that may continue to drive its value upwards.

In contrast, other popular meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have seen declines of 6% and 3% respectively over the last month. The larger meme coin market cap has now dipped below $50 billion, showcasing a stark shift in the market dynamics that were previously much more favorable for meme tokens.

As the crypto space continues to evolve, investors should keep a watchful eye on developments within the meme coin niche, where community sentiment and market trends can dramatically influence price movements.

A little back story: He's agitated mostly in the evenings, and I'm not sure if this is due to him being leashed as a yard dog by his previous owner. But he now has a comfy dog bed in our living room, but we still hear him whimper and bark at night for no apparent reason.

Will calming treats help him relax? Thanks for all your help!

**Edit**: Thank you for all your replies. They were really helpful! So we did try a couple of things to help him relax at night. We added more walks and tried having him near our room with our doors open when we sleep at night. The cries and barks became less frequent, but he still has his moments. Then we gave in and asked our vet about calming treats, and he recommended [Wuffles](https://redditlink.click/wuffes). Since then, things became even more calm for him. Hopefully this works long-term.",0.13574561403508772,13,35

She’s my sweet girl though. Anyway, what breeds do you think she has in her? The people who bought her were told she was full chocolate lab. I did one DNA test a few years ago and it came back as mostly Shiba Inu (wtf?), and hardly any lab. I got a different brand that I’ve been meaning to have done and sent out for results, so I’m going to do that this week.

2025-04-10,"Bump on senior dog elbow My 13 year old spayed female Shiba Inu has had this bump on her left elbow for quite awhile now. I’ve been monitoring it and recently noticed that it is now changed colors and gotten ever so slightly bigger. It used to be all pink with a small black/dark grey spot. Always been soft/squishy and she doesn’t care if I mess with it. Now it is almost all completely black/dark grey. Still no reaction from her when I mess with it. It doesn’t smell, or have anything coming out of it. She does have chronic kidney disease but her tests for that have been good recently. She has also been battling allergies that we are trying to figure out. She gets cytopoint injections and has been on apoquel. Currently she gets the injections and is on Zerenia for allergies. She’s also on ketoconazole for a skin fungal infection. Been on the zerenia and keto for almost a month now and it’s since then that the changes have occurred on the bump. She has a vet appointment next week to check her status and I plan on having them look at that while we are there, but figured I would post here in case anyone has any input on what it could be. Posted link to photo below. Thanks!

2025-04-10,"SHIB Daily Projection: Thursday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

It appears that we Consolidated just as expected within a healthy Neutral range as the market continues to pick up Buy pressure in the Short term. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers are emerging and exerting strength, leading to a Neutral ground with Buyers establishing control of the market across multiple time frames. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is WITHIN the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands continue to expand, confirming a Consolidation phase. ADX values show Average Trend strength while the price remains ABOVE our Supertrend and AT our Short term EMAs, all while attempting to revitalize ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the expansion of the Bollinger Bands with rising Volatility toward the HIGH end of our norms range. Price movements remain WITHIN the Volatility Bands, which supports the extended Consolidation phase. Volume Indicators highlight decreased participation, signaling a wait-and-see phase among investors as they gauge the market's next direction. Money flow has turned Neutral with plenty of room in either direction, depending on what investors decide in the Short term.

Sentiment Indicators signal a reversal in the market as a new emerging positive Trend cycle demonstrates Strong levels of accumulation. This renewed level of participation has nearly neutralized the Long term negative Trend cycle, but there is still some ground to recover. News articles offer renewed Bullish bias for Long term potential, featuring reports on resilient technical Support levels, ecosystem milestones and upgrades, and whale accumulation. Despite the renewed Bullish narrative, the articles still address Short term struggles such as a HIGH percentage of holders experiencing losses, reduced token burn rates, and a test of the 13-Month LOW. These reports address the realistic Short term Volatility struggles of this asset class while also encouraging investors and continuing to alleviate FUD/FOMO.

From what I can tell, the market in a broader context is attempting to stabilize. Typically, we would expect the dynamic to follow a narrow trading range in the Short term as investors build confidence and comfort while deciding what direction to take the market next. Underlying this are some Bullish impulses, but otherwise the market will likely look to establish some Neutral ground.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that the price is resting just ABOVE the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001150. At MAX, we will follow the 4-Week retracements and test the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. At LOWEST, we will slip down and test the ‘Wall of Support’ near the midway level at the 1st level Support pivot point at $0.00001090.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

Vet thought maybe a little Shiba Inu in her, along with some other breeds. Redditors and irl folks, including my wife and I, had all sorts of guesses for possible breeds in her mix. Husky was one of the more frequent guesses among the wide variety of guesses. But I'm pretty sure no one guessed any of her actual breeds lol. My wife and I sure didn't. Actually, one redditor suggested Akita, which is likely part of her supermutt heritage. Other than that, though, I don't think anyone guessed these breeds.

So the login/RGB pets, the premium subscription pets, the current event pets, and the lure pets (with the infinite lure bait as the previous baits are technically out of the game).

F- are 'AM bucks, currency-based pets', R- is the Robux pets, E- for event pets (and yes Sakura is double counted as event and robux, wasn't sure how to count it as both, or only robux), P- Premium (as it's not paid with robux but still cost real world money) and ? for the lure pets.

2025-04-09,"SHIB Daily Projection: WedNesDay Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Our expectation was for an external catalyst to invigorate the market, and that is exactly what we witnessed. Momentum Indicators show that Buyers stepped in during the very Short term, leading to a Bullish rate of change that contested Seller control across multiple time frames and resulted in only Weak Seller dominance. Trend Indicators reveal that the price is ABOVE the Ichimoku Cloud, bouncing off the HIGH Band, while Bollinger Bands expand to signal an upcoming phase of Consolidation. The ADX values show Strong Trend strength, with the price positioned ABOVE the Supertrend and all EMAs, indicating that the current market is active with ‘Price Action’. Volatility Indicators support the Consolidation phase as Volatility approaches the Neutral of our norms range. Volatility Bands provide a breakout signal, which aligns with a Bullish Consolidation outlook. Volume Indicators continue to signal active market participation throughout these phases, with a neutralized Short term money flow while opening substantial room for price movements before reaching Overbought levels.

Sentiment Indicators highlight Strong levels of distribution, although these are considerably weaker compared to our previous averages. Despite aggressive investors returning to the market, the emerging positive Trend cycle is weak when compared to the strength in the Long term negative Trend cycle as shown by PVT values. News articles have been increasingly active in presenting a realistic view of the market by emphasizing whale participation and token burns as the main narrative. With such a realistic perspective on Shiba Inu price movements, the Long term narrative remains Bullish while still cautioning against Short term Volatility. This realistic view serves to alleviate FUD/FOMO among investors.

We are following expected market dynamics based on measurable technical indicators, but there is an external factor we must contend with. These latest price movements show that despite our best efforts, the market is controlled by players much larger than ourselves. I believe that a phase of wait-and-see will lead to a Consolidation of gains in the Short term before Buy pressure intensifies enough to test Resistance prices and establish higher Neutral zones.

Long term Support and Resistances indicate that the price is WITHIN the ’Wall of Resistance’, currently resting just BELOW the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230. This position acts as the Short term Neutral major pivot point. At MAX, the price will follow the 4-Week retracement levels to test the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week HIGH at $0.00001360. At LOWEST, the price will retreat back to the Long term Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001100.

New here. I’m not a crypto guy, never have been. So forgive me for my lack of knowledge. 

In September of 2021, I had a three coworkers (who were all brothers) who couldn’t seem to stop talking about crypto currency. One of those cryptos being gaugecash, or gaugefield. They all showed me their crypto wallets, each of them having between $260k-$380k worth of crypto coins. They had dozens and dozens of different coins, with tens of thousands of dollars invested in each. From big/recognizeable ones like BTC and ETH and Chainlink to smaller ones like HBAR and that shiba-inu one. They had convinced me that within two or three years, this stable coin called GAUF would come out and skyrocket in value. They each had about $20k-$30k worth of GAUF each. One of them had almost 400k GAUF coins. So due to their knowledge, prior investments, and confidence, I believed them. I don’t believe they were malicious, just mistaken.

I ended up investing about $4,200 into GAUF. I won’t give out the exact amount I have but I have between 30k-60k GAUF coins. At the time, there were updates coming out, on the gaugecash website and on reddit, and then the gaugecash wallet came out. Manuel Blanco went on stage at some conference to talk about his project. I was all in. Now it’s now April of 2025 and am now convinced I just lost $4.2k years ago. No updates, no changes to the website, no word from Blanco, no post on their Reddit, nothing. I’m disappointed and annoyed, but not looking for retribution or revenge, and am obviously expecting to be grilled here. All I would like to know is when I should have known I was scammed.

2025-04-09,"🚨 65% Of All Shiba Inu Holders Now Underwater As Profitability Drops To 2024 Levels Shiba Inu investors are navigating some tricky waters as the SHIB price remains a staggering 87% below its all-time high reached in 2021. With recent price crashes, quite a few investors are feeling the heat, as profitability has dwindled back to early 2024 levels.

Did you know that a whopping 65% of Shiba Inu investors are currently nursing losses? The past year has seen SHIB decline over 60%, wiping out most of the recovery we witnessed at the start of 2024. Reports show that while 32% of investors are in the green, just 3% are managing to break even.

According to fresh data, only about 98.2 trillion SHIB worth $1.12 billion is seeing gains, compared to a hefty 878.5 trillion SHIB valued at $9.99 billion that’s in the red. The only sweet spot? An insignificant 8.14 trillion SHIB, worth $92.59 million, is resting right at breakeven.

Profitability for Shiba Inu has historically been a rollercoaster ride. After hitting peak levels in October 2021, it’s been a struggle for holders ever since. Even with a rollercoaster comeback into December 2024, 2025 is throwing a different game into the mix with profitability sinking to lows not experienced since early 2024.

But don’t throw in the towel just yet! Bulls still seem to believe in a price recovery for SHIB, especially with recent spikes in large transactions. More than 100% increase in large transaction volumes suggests that we may be seeing renewed interest in this meme coin. If buying momentum builds, a recovery might just be on the horizon.

Stay tuned, because in the world of crypto, even the underdog can rise to the occasion.

2025-04-09,"SOS! 🚨 Puppy Not Getting Along With Cats!!! Hello Puppy101 Reddit, I come to you on behalf of two friends of mine who are facing a crisis.

My friends, a couple who I will call Vee and Church for the sake of this post, have been dating for years. They've lived together with two cats but recently decided to try adding a Shiba Inu puppy to their family.

Well, puppies will do as they will, and she is an excitable little bundle of fur, and Vee can't handle it. The puppy keeps charging the cats, she's excited and reactive to them. The younger cat doesn't care, but the 11-year old cat she has had for years is depressed, lethargic, and refuses to come out of the bedroom.

They live in a one bedroom one bathroom apartment. And if the puppy and cat cannot get along then Vee plans to send her back to the breeder in Japan. (We live in the Americas)

My family and I tried to take the puppy in this past Friday, unfortunately that plan has fallen apart because my Mom's long dormant allergy has kicked up and it's getting to the point she cannot breathe.

Vee and Chruch are devastated, especially for Church who LOVES this dog. But Vee is terrified because their vet said the dog might try to kill the cats because Shiba's are hunting breeds.

This puppy is smart, and responds VERY well to treat rewards. She just recently turned 4 months old. (I started practicing ""Leave it"" with her on Saturday, and she's shown so much rapid understanding and improvement!! I've never owned a dog btw!!!) But im afraid if Vee doesn't see improvement with the cats soon, the puppy is getting kicked out.

Please, does anybody have any quick tips to help keep her calm around the cats? Any tutorials I can reference? I really want to help my friends!!! I have faith in this dog's ability to learn! I keep trying to push the idea of getting her to a trainer, but idk if they're taking to it.

Please help!!!

**Edit:** Thank you to everyone who commented. Unfortunately, it looks like the dog is going back to the breeder. I know there are many stories like this one of a dog just not fitting in a household. I was hoping that this could be different, but ultimately not in this case. Everything happens for a reason, so I suppose they needed this experience. Thank you all again for the people who even read this post.

Even if it is sad, I know one thing: That no matter where this sweet little puppy ends up, she will be deeply loved, and that is the most important thing.

2025-04-08,"SHIB Daily Projection: Tuesday Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to a new day as we dive into Shiba Inu analysis together.

Resiliency continues with signs of dip buying from aggressive whale investors, which is helping to hold the market at what appears to be a Short term Neutral ground. Momentum Indicators confirm that the price is in Neutral territory, with dip buying smoothing the rate of change across multiple time frames and weakening the outright control of Sellers in the market. Trend Indicators show that the price is BELOW the Ichimoku Cloud, while Bollinger Bands are beginning to contract and reveal early signs of breakout potential. ADX values highlight Average Trend strength as the price hovers near the Supertrend but remains BELOW all EMAs. Volatility Indicators reveal an increase in Volatility, supporting the contraction of the Bollinger Bands. Volatility Bands confirm that the price is in Oversold territory, which further supports the potential for a breakout. Volume Indicators continue to signal market participation from Buyers in the dips over both the Short and Long term, leading to a neutralized Short term flow, although more money continues to flow out of the market than in over the Long term. 

Sentiment Indicators suggest that this may have been the bottom of capitulation, with Strong distribution approaching some of the highest values seen in a while. Despite the extreme Sell pressure throughout the market, the weight of Seller control only added slight strength to the very Short term negative Trend cycle, while aggressive whale participation during the dips helped to weaken the Long term negative Trend cycle. News articles have begun to cover the Long term Bullish potential of the market by highlighting technical breakouts, on-chain metrics, and burn rates as signs of positive developments, recovery, and expected price surges. Despite the increase in positive narratives, there remain cautions about Short term Volatility stemming from the significant market pain investors are experiencing during this period of panic. These articles are highly accurate and do well to alleviate FUD/FOMO for investors entering the market.

All of these signals combine to paint a picture of a prevailing Bearish Trend running sideways through Consolidation, as the market attempts to find stable footing, gather positive Sentiment, and increase participation while waiting for an external catalyst. It is this resiliency that leads me to expect the Consolidation phase to continue while the market tests Support and Resistance benchmarks.

Long term Support and Resistances reveal that we are resting in the Neutral zone just BELOW the Neutral major pivot point at $0.00001140, which is positioned ABOVE the ‘Wall of Support’. At LOWEST, the price will test the critical psychological Support level at $0.00001000. Falling BELOW this price would mean that the market could mathematically reach a BOTTOM where the 14-Day RSI is at 20%, near $0.00000690. At MAX, the price will attempt to follow the 4-Week retracement levels, with the first test being the 38.2% retracement of the 4-Week LOW at $0.00001230.

As always, I wish you all the best of luck with your life. Thank you for your continued support. Remember, bullying always hurts, so hug your loved ones and let them know they're the most important to you in the world.

2025-04-08,"Vestibular Disease and Librela Hello all, looking for advice, my Shiba Inu is 17 years old and in November of 2023 she had a severe vestibular event. Long story short she had 3 weeks of immobility but the first week was the worst where it seemed as if her hind legs were non responsive. Luckily she pulled through and is about 70% recovered, slight head tilt and occasional loss of balance. No one is sure what caused it but she had a librela shot 3 weeks prior but critically she also had garlic and spicy peppers the week before (my mom mistaken fed her human meal prep rather than the dog meal prep that I made (which consists of ground beef, sweet potato, broccoli, spinach, and eggs). I believe Librela has been generally successful and I've seen my friends benefit from the treatment. But at that point in time I was unsure if librela was for my dog. However.. 

  
In the past month, I've seen a noticeable decline in her mobility to the point where I am considering librela again. I am afraid that if she gets librela again then another vestibular event would be a death sentence. 

  
She has other issues, Osteoarthritis, Cushing disease was diagnosed August of 2024 but she does not display all the classic symptoms just yet (no excessive drinking, eat, pot belly) but she does pant various times of the day and have muscle atrophy. Overall her appetite is good (not great) and she still loves walks and exploring. But there are also notable declines in her interests in the past month. 

Has anyone ever been in my situation? Librela potentially causing vestibular but still considering the treatment again? What does everyone think about my situation,.

2025-04-08,"🚨 Shibarium’s Latest Milestone Fails to Stop SHIB’s Nosedive: Details The recent advancements in the Shiba Inu ecosystem have not shielded SHIB from significant price downturns. The Layer 2 blockchain solution, Shibarium, achieved a remarkable milestone by surpassing the 10 million blocks added, with total transactions now exceeding one billion. This initiative, launched in August 2023, promises to enhance the meme coin's performance through reduced transaction costs and improved scalability.

Despite these achievements, SHIB's value plummeted by 13% in just one day, dropping to around $0.00001053. This decline adds to the ongoing struggle of the wider crypto market, which has been rattled by global trade tensions. Major cryptocurrencies like $BTC and $ETH also felt the impact, witnessing a dip below critical price levels.

Investors should be wary of the current trends impacting the meme coin. The burning rate of SHIB tokens has significantly dropped by almost 85% in the past week, with only 180 million tokens being destroyed. This reduction could hinder the asset's scarcity and potential price appreciation. Additionally, increased net flows into exchanges suggest a pivot towards centralized platforms, amplifying selling pressure in the market.

As the trade war's ramifications unfold, the potential for further declines in the cryptocurrency sector looms large. Keeping an eye on SHIB's burn mechanisms and exchange activity will be critical for investors looking to navigate this volatile landscape.

2025-04-08,"Breed recommendations Before I get to the copy and paste form I would just like to thank anyone who helps! I'm eager to get a puppo in our home! I am also some what disabled and on bad flare up days where I can't do too too much I'd like to have some company. 


**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

*I have had dogs all my life with the majority of my experience being with pit bulls, they are my favorites!!! My husband has also been raised with dogs. I have personally done rough training with two of my families dogs in the past.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I would prefer to rescue our hopeful addition but since I know I have limited options I am not against buying from a breeder. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* My ideal dog would be an affectionate playful dog, one that will enjoy daily activity but in the case of something happening(is: I'm sick and my husband isn't around) they'd be okay with a day or two here and there of a brief walk. I want to be able to cuddle my dog and go on adventures!

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* In a perfect world I'd get a pitbull, they're (I'm biased I know) the best dogs, but literally 7 days ago my apartment changed the rules of what dog breeds are allowed and pitbulls were officially banned. Otherwise I love staffies, corgis, Shiba Inu's, and Australian shepherds.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* I'd like to keep the training on the semi simpler side unless the dog breed would benefit from more training then that. They will have no job other then to be spoiled and loved and watching my favorite period dramas with me. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* No, this dog will be living the life of a single spoiled child. 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I'm willing to put in as much work as whatever the breed standard is! At minimum I'd like to be able to active play with them a half hour each day so dogs prone to getting tired super quick probably aren't the best option. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I will always at minimum dedicate a half hour to walks with any additional play time in our patio or apartment every day, on days I do not have work or are otherwise unwell I will likely be spending a decent amount of time actively playing and engaging with them. They will have three doggy cousins that they will get to play with and see regularly and I hope to bring them to dog parks(should that be ideal for them) regularly! I love going to parks with trails a lot in the summer/spring/fall so they will be getting a lot of walk and play time through that as well. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I personally find grooming time as a really fun bonding time and am willing to do semi extensive grooming up to once a week, things such as quick brush throughs or quick ear cleans I'd be fine doing daily if required. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* In a perfect world I'd have the biggest dog I could find but unfortunately my apartment has a 25 pound limit. So as big as you can get with that kind of weight limit 😅. I'm figuring that doesn't get much bigger then a Shiba Inu though.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I doubt the dog will be able to shed more fur then I do hair but for a serious answer I'm fine with high levels of shedding, slobber is fine with me since I was raised with a slobber queen. And as for barking anything husky level of frequency may be out of the question just due to my apartment. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* I'll take it or leave it! Whatever is safest and more comfortable for both of us. I likely wouldn't unleash them in any public area unless they had recall training. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* SNUGGGLYYYYY. I wanna be able to cuddle this dog as much as possible, I love laying and petting and cuddling with my pets. I will never force it on them if they don't want to cuddle however. 

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Overall I think somewhere in the middle, maybe balancing more towards eager to please. I want them to be able to entertain themselves should I be busy but be happy to drop it's current thing if I wanna go for a walk with them or play. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I'm not sure I fully know how to answer this question, I don't want a protector dog whose alert and territorial of the home. I know thats just the personality of some dogs regardless of breed(not as far as resource guarding but just territory wise I suppose?) I understand many times it comes down to socializing at a young age which will be a form of training I'll be taking on. I know sometimes though some dogs are just reactive no matter what you do. So I guess I'd like them to be friendly and welcoming but if they're shy, or tentative that's also okay with me!

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I'd like to avoid it but as I said previously I know some dogs just end up being reactive no matter what training you do, I am willing to help and have a dog that's aggressive to others, we can be anti social together!!!(By help I mean try to lessen their reactivity and take precautions that keep both them, me, and others safe like muzzles in public)

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Dogs will have their own personality outside of their breed so I am prepared for whatever comes! But I understand some personalities are more common in some breeds, if I can avoid a dog that tends to attach to one owner and no one else that'd be great so that both me and my husband can enjoy the dog equally. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* My husband works full time, however I work partially from home, and part time out. I will be home a majority of the week and one of the days I would not be home my husband would be. They likely may only ever be alone for a few hours once or twice a week if that. (We both have consistent schedules but mine is currently being changed to a new one so I can't give a full definitive answer) 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My husband is the only other house occupant and while I have been saying me and I these are our shared sentiments for the most part!! (He loves pitbulls too I just love them more) we will both take care of this dog fully and committedly! As I am home more often I will likely take on more responsibilities regularly.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No other pets in the home! For the foreseeable future this dog will be an only child as we do not currently want to own more then one at a time. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Almost certainly not, not anytime soon anyways. We want to have kids but not for at least several years. 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We are currently in a gated community with an HOA limitation of 25 pounds which has led to me reaching out for advice since very few dogs we both like are in that weight class. They recently added a few breed restrictions that were not previously there (which further stunted our plans) such as pitt bull, Rottweiler, doberman pinchers, German shepherd, chow chow, Siberian husky and wolf dogs(they also wrote any breeds with a history of aggressive tendencies, which makes me question how chihuahuas are allowed) most of these breeds are wayyyy out of the weight limit so I don't know why they added them?

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live in NY USA. Where I live there are not dog breeds bans as far as I'm aware but I believe there may be restrictions in certain towns

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Winter averages 25°F but definitely gets colder and summer averages 84°F but I've personally felt like it's been 100+ at least once a summer for a week 🤣

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* this is now where the trickiest bit comes into play, me and my husband are not the biggest fans of dogs like Chihuahuas, shih tzus, papillons, pugs (any dog with facial forms that ultimately lead to a lot of health issues) or even poodles. I'm not really a small dog fan In general but I know I can't be too picky and I am willing to compromise. me and my husband narrowed it down to three breeds currently (Shiba Inu, corgi, mini Australian shepherd) all with pros and cons. So I'd like to know what your suggestions are outside of the list I made that are completely out of the question(the chihuahuas, pugs etc.) If your suggestion is one of the three we've narrowed it down to I'd love to know how much you think they'd blend in with what our ✨ideal✨ dog is. And please keep in mind I absolutely know with the limitations I have that there may not be a dog that matches all these preferences and I am okay with that!! I'm mostly just trying to see what other options there are so we can make the best choice for all involved.
