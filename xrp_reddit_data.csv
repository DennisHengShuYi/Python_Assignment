Reddit,XRP,1l3b1zj,2025-06-04 17:07:56,"XRP vs. SEC: The Slowdown I've been involved with XRP for quite a while now, and I constantly find myself pondering why its price remains so low. It boasts incredible utility and numerous partnerships, yet it's only hovering around $2. When you introduce someone new to XRP and highlight its massive potential, the first thing they often say after looking it up is, ""Only $2?""
I've come to a conclusion that, to me, makes the most sense: XRP was on the verge of fundamentally disrupting the financial institutions' established money-making systems. To prevent this, they initiated a lawsuit, effectively slowing down its progress. This delay gives them time to figure out how they can still profit while eventually leveraging Ripple's underlying technology.
 Do you agree with this theory, or do you have a different perspective on XRP's current price action?","The current price reflects the current level of **active** utility. Once more of the **theoretical** utility is translated into **active** utility, the price will self adjust. This will take years. So if here for quick gains, you will be disappointed. The roller coaster will continue and you will see both ups and downs. ||| “I constantly find myself pondering why its price remains so low”

I wouldn’t necessarily consider the fourth largest cryptocurrency to be “low priced”, but that’s just me. Only the future will tell if two-and-a-quarter on June 4, 2025 was actually a “low price” or not. ||| That is the entire game plan... ||| Yessir. I have said a similar thing to my friends. Watch who is onboarding, not what the guardians of ‘the system’ say. 👍🏻 #HODL ||| 99% of the partnerships are bullshit ! ||| It's down bad right now because tariffs are fucking with people's willingness and ability to make cross border payments, which is what XRP is designed for. ||| The fine print on those ""partnerships"" will show that Ripple is affording payments to its institutional users, most likely to continue the ""Army"" to buy in and aid in funding it's many other projects.  ""Brad"" is not your friend folks, stop watching for his next blockbuster announcement, its nothing more than fodder to keep us supporting their other interests.  As interest is waning, Ripple will see that there is another run up, probably cracking 5.00, thats when they will release another billion.  What did everyone think when they didnt release the planned amount when it was 2.00?  We have been played big time and if there was ever a time when I would like Govt oversight it's with these clowns and what they are peddling ||| Whatever the result SEC regulations only applies in the USA, 

What has stopped financial institutions using XRP all this time?. Nothing in law preventing them now so what SEC is seeking legal clarification.  Laws change all the time nobody cares until the change happens. 

XRP isn't faster or cheaper for cross border payments. 
I have tried it,  I had to pay broker to buy it, other end had to use broker to exchange back to fiat and cost 4% more than bank to bank,  broker fees alone cost more. 
Plus waiting period broker to release transfer fiat. Plus xrp value dropped in time I bought, transferred to wallet, sent ,other end transfer from wallet, to broker, sell it. 

Financial institutions would rip each others face off for 1% reduced costs,  if it was cheaper faster and more secure,  they would be using it untill it was illegal ||| People stop falling for XRP lol? ||| Nice they/them pronouns who the hell are you talking about ||| They wanted to put ripple outvof business and have our us dollar not be the reserve currency.  Trump saved the day as stable coins will be backed by us treasury is my understanding..and the Saudis have agreed to make xrp the countries stockpile and use the ripple ledger for all oil transaction...is what i read between the lines ...so our country and dollar have been saved ...for now...purchasing power is still decreasing but what happened to Brics....remember all that noise....Trump shut them down it appears ||| If you're in XRP for growth you picked the wrong crypto ||| Infinite supply, centralized, has is operated in a manner than requires it to comply or get shut down.  Basically, complete garbage. ||| Simple question Bank A cross border Bank B seamless and in seconds using XRP.  Where does bank A buy XRP and where does Bank B sell XRP?  

XRP has to be is it $10000 or $50000 idk according to one or all Brad Ripple or Katz.  At $3k ripple could buy every share on the global stock market then I think almost every cross border payment will be from one ripple owned company to another ripple owned company ||| This is bollocks, adoption has been severely limited because off-ramp to USD has been a hinderance. XRP will work seamlessly with global adoption. Sending XRP is the quickest way to transfer crypto, it's impossible that you would have lost/gained money from the value it has dropped/gained in 2 seconds. You are making things up or deluded or both. ||| You're confusing front-end transactions with back-end transactions. The banks settle things. But your interface to them is the old classical system. If you want to send XRP, just transfer to that wallet. However that is not what all the fuzz is about of course. There are international banks already running on XRP in their backend. Anyone with accounts with them have flawless cross border payment. But it has nothing to do with you as a customer having XRP. We're not talking about exchanges but banks! ||| Sorry for the  confusion 😆 ||| YTD would beg to differ ||| What do you suggest? ||| ""Infinite supply"" confirms bro don't know none about XRP ||| Tell me you know nothing about XRP without telling me you know nothing about XRP. ||| I usually ignore statements like this, but the whole thing is a lie. ||| So when USD is globally adopted as one world currency XRP will work seamlessly. ?? 

Then if USD is adopted as the global currency why would anyone need to exchange £,€,¥..to USD buy XRP sell XRP for  USD then exchange into £,€,¥... So can you tell me where can I buy XRP in my currency for free and sell my XRP for free because I am sure USD is only accepted as payment in USA and shit hole countries,  

My question is very simple I want to use XRP for cross border payments,   where can buyer / seller exchange xrp to local fiat without cost of broker either end. ||| >There are international banks already running on XRP in their backend. Anyone with accounts with them have flawless cross border payment

You do know you can see how much xrp is moving,   around  $ 60 Billion every  24hrs.  Doesn't suggest international banks adoption ||| yes, right, that whopping 6% ||| A gazillion in supply that will take 200 years to burn is mostly infinite for us that are alive. ||| XRP is used by banks as settlement layer. This is not about transferring coins to other wallets. That is not ""settling"", that's just payment. It's a financial instrument not simply payment. ||| Excuse me, previous 52 weeks ||| ""a gazillion supply"" another kid who don't know none about XRP 🤣",27,40
Reddit,XRP,1l22w68,2025-06-03 04:26:02,"Chart Info & Trading Analysis I’m a long term trader and investor. I’ve been around since the start of crypto, called DOGE many of times and other currencies with 80% or more accuracy.

Here is the chart information for XRP.
1 Week graphs show a strong bull flag.
5m graphs show another increase.

Within 2 months max we should be around $3.50 again and with upcoming ETF launches and more coming in July we could see $10 with FOMO investors.

Remove XRP from exchanges and store in a cold wallet.

The reason XRP price is not rising is because of Ripple holding 43% of total supply while the rest remain on exchanges. The $10mil or more investments from institutional companies are made on the private ledger priced at $375,000 per XRP while the global public ledger on exchanges are at the rates shown in the images.

Ripple will merge the two wallet after 2028-2030 when full integration of ISO 20022 is implemented. Either way, the 1 week candles show a strong buy signal coming up very soon.","The private ledger price has been debunked by the top brass at Ripple. ||| Dont know but why would someone pay 375.000 for 1xrp when you can buy 1xrp for 2,2dollars? If there was a separate ledger wouldnt the price be lower then the public one? ||| I suggest you go read up on iso20022 implementation dates yours are wildly inaccurate ||| What's this 10m on private ledger at 375k per unit? I bet you have some source on this. Link or something. ||| Lol I know it's gone up in price a bit which is lovely. But can't help but feel like I'm back in 2017 with this ""it'll be 3.50 in a month and 10 soon after"". ||| Is there a source for this? Im genuinely interested ||| The private ledger im referring to is the accumulated donations vs price of XRP on exchanges to the total supply ripple holds in escrow for the institutions and controlling circulating supply. ||| They still are buying at the same price as everyone which drove the private ledger price higher. It’s just institutions buying directly from ripples escrowed supply. The escrow is the private ledger. ||| I understand it’s taking affect July 14th, I only said 2028-2030 because the Feds can’t change their whole network over night. It’s going to take time for the banks to integrate and re-adopt a new financial system on the Ripple Network. It’s a global change that can’t happen overnight. Even the US dollar took 100 years to become a currency. ||| And for the record, I, too, was temporarily excited with the hopium that our $1 token was going to merge with a $300k token. $1 being the DCA of my largest bag. ||| I didn't save the source. I did see it though. Can't remember which of the top 3 was being interviewed, but they said there are no separate private ledgers. Some customers are given privileged rights to make anonymous transactions on the ledger, governments, for example, but there is no separate ledger and no 2 tier pricing. Make of that what you will. Could have been deep fake. I don't dig for my xrp news. It has to be easy to find, relevant, and not from a click-baiter on YT. So if I stumbled across it, you could easily find it. Might even have been here that I found it. ||| Right. Well most of mine is in cold storage anyway.

Reddit,XRP,1kwqqar,2025-05-27 15:50:08,"Dubai announces Real Estate Tokenization Platform on XRP Ledger The new platform lets investors buy fractional ownership in Dubai property, with title deeds tokenized on the XRP Ledger network.

 Dubai government agency debuted its first real estate tokenization platform, teaming up with real estate fintech Prypco and infrastructure provider Ctrl Alt.

The Prypco Mint platform tokenizes title deeds on the XRP Ledger, syncing with official property records.
The platform builds on the agency's initiative that projects to tokenize 7%, or $16 billion worth, of Dubai’s real estate market by 2033.

The Dubai Land Department (DLD), a government agency for the real estate industry, has launched its first tokenized real estate platform as part of a government-backed effort that could see $16 billion worth of real estate digitized by 2033.

The platform, called Prypco Mint and developed in partnership with real estate fintech firm Prypco, allows investors to purchase fractional ownership in Dubai properties using local currency starting at 2,000 dirhams, or about $540, according to a Sunday press release by the agency.

Source: Coin Desk","Even with new tech like tokenized real estate, Dubai’s property market has too many buildings and not enough demand. The city keeps adding more, but buyers aren’t keeping up. A global recession is coming, and people will be more careful with money.

Reddit,XRP,1kwk44r,2025-05-27 10:44:41,XRP Decentralization Clarified by Ripple CTO David Schwartz,"I don't think he lays his decentralization argument out very well. Nor does he mention that Ripple controls 43% of all XRP coins, most of them in escrow with 1 billion released monthly (some of which is sold by Ripple).

I am a long term holder, but I have to admit - XRP is pretty centralized 😆🤭 ||| I think exactly the opposite. XRP was about having a fixed supply from the get go with a pre-announced drip schedule of the supply.

The network is decentralized in the sense that it runs on enough machines to be geographically redundant, and it intentionally does not use proof of work or staking because it wants to keep transaction costs down.

It is totally fine to disagree with their assumptions, but ripple is not centralized in the way they talk about centralization, and they are clear in their definition. ||| Fair points!",26,8

Reddit,XRP,1kidovr,2025-05-09 08:43:28,"Trade like a casino. Not like a gambler. Casinos don't win every hand.

They win over time - because they have rules, odds, and discipline.

Let's take an example:

American roulette has 38 numbers: 1–36, 0, and 00.

If you bet $1 on a single number, you win $35 if it hits.

Your chance of winning = 1/38  
Your chance of losing = 37/38

The Expected Value (EV) per $1 bet:  
= (Win probability × Win payout)  
\+ (Lose probability × Loss)  
That's −0.0526.

So on average, you lose 5.26 cents for every $1 bet.  
That’s a 5.26% loss per spin.

The house edge = the expected loss per $1 bet.

So, 5.26% is the casino’s built-in profit margin on that game.

It’s not luck. It’s mathematical advantage over time.

Here's what you should do:

🎯	Know your edge  
Every strategy must have a positive expectancy. If it doesn't — stop trading.

📊	Play the long game	  
Single trades are noise. Your edge shows up over 100+ trades.

💰	Risk small per trade

📏	Stick to the system	No emotions. No chasing. Just execution.

From James Filan:

Next Steps:  Judge Torres needs to provide an indicative ruling as to whether the Court would: 

(1) dissolve the injunction and release the escrow with $50 million going to the SEC and the balance back to Ripple; 

(2) if Judge Torres provides the indicative ruling, the SEC and Ripple will ask the Second Circuit for a limited remand back to Judge Torres to ask for the relief described above; 

(3) upon the granting of the remand, the SEC and Ripple will file a motion with Judge Torres asking for the relief described above; 

(4) after the injunction is dissolved and the funds distributed, the SEC and Ripple will ask the Court of Appeals to dismiss the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal.

Liquidity events, narratives, insider flows make prices move.

Price discounts everything. Price moves in trends. History repeats itself.

Knowing all that, you can win slightly more over time. But no one, absolutely no one is right all the time. So risk management is key.

Is that even true, or is it just good at creating narrative fallacies that sound good out of historical data? ||| > If a strategy is right 60% of the time, you beat the market over time.

Reddit,XRP,1kgzgtr,2025-05-07 14:59:25,"How come Ripple faces no competition? In regards to cross-border payments, the following could be considered competitors - though none are truly formidable:

1. CBDCs: Could offer seamless funds-transmission between different currencies, but requires (1) the development of currency-specific CBDCs, which only a handful of countries have done, (2) a major reconfiguration of the banking system within said country, and (3) interoperability between CBDCs.

2. SWIFT’s GPI: Though it takes a lot less time than traditional cross-border settlements, it can still take a few hours up to a day and is thus incomparable to XRP’s speed.

3. Stablecoins: Require pre-funded liquidity pools, have higher fees than XRP, and face regulatory hurdles.

XRP seems to be vastly ahead with its instant ODL, unmatched speed, negligible fees, regulatory compliance, ISO 20022 integration, tokenomics, and ease of practical application.","Because is made by the elite(the controlling entity of us).

Reddit,XRP,1k5j4yg,2025-04-22 22:12:04,"Help Recovering XRP from Toast Wallet I’m reaching out for help recovering XRP from an old Toast Wallet, as I’ve hit a roadblock and need advice from anyone familiar with Toast Wallet’s recovery process. I’ve read through older posts and FAQs but haven’t found a clear solution for my situation. I’d appreciate any guidance, especially from those who’ve dealt with similar issues or know the technical side of Toast Wallet’s JSON backups.

I have the following:

Json backup (it loads on the toast github browser page, I can see the balance etc)
6 digit code (it works on the browser app to unlock it)
I also have 2 more codes written down right under the wallet address when i first created the wallet in oct 2018 - BUT they are apparently not the FAMILY seed. The first code starting with sgyWiu... (64 characters, ends with a hyphen), which I thought was the XRP secret key (Family Seed). However, Xaman (Xumm) rejected it as invalid, even after removing the hyphen. It’s too long for a standard XRP secret key (~29 characters), so it might be an encrypted field or a corrupted code. I also have a code starting with YhHH... (also long, with a hyphen), but it doesn’t match any standard XRP key or JSON field. It might be a mislabeled backup or irrelevant. Its also 64 characters plus a hyphen at the end.

I have tried all my known passwords but non of them work. Is there anyway to recover the xrp ? or anybody know what these 64/65 characters codes are ?","Is there a bounty for this? ||| I don’t really know much but this is what I was able to dig up. 

Option 1: Use Your Secret Key (sXXXXXXXX…)

If you saved your XRP secret key, you can import it into one of the following:
	•	XUMM Wallet (recommended)
	•	Ledger (hardware wallet, via XRP toolkit)
	•	GateHub
	•	Exodus

XUMM is XRP-native, actively maintained, and supports importing old Toast accounts.

Option 2: Use a Backup File

If you only have the encrypted backup file (.txt) and wallet password, you can decrypt the key:
	1.	Use the community-built recovery tool (open-source):
	•	https://toastwallet.github.io/recover/
	•	This tool decrypts your backup file and retrieves the XRP secret key (locally in your browser).
Make sure you’re offline or inspect the source code if concerned about security.
	2.	Once decrypted, import the XRP secret key into another wallet (e.g., XUMM).

⸻

Security Warning
	•	Never share your secret key or backup file with anyone.
	•	Avoid any third-party services that ask for your keys to “recover” your XRP unless open source and locally run.
	•	Don’t reinstall Toast Wallet – it’s no longer secure or maintained.

⸻

If You Only Have a 6–8 Word Recovery Phrase

Toast did not use BIP39 or standard mnemonic phrases. If you only have a phrase and no file or secret key, recovery is unlikely unless it was used to generate a password or key for the encrypted file.

Good Luck. ||| Brother I have the exact same issue right now I have a team working on for me (@10%). Do you have the og computer you placed your buys on by chance? ||| I’ll swap all of my advice regarding what worked what didn’t just dm me ||| What I did was to reset my password

I couldn't reset my Password in the new versions of toast (as it only allowed use of passphrase - which u had forgotten)

Fortunately for me, 2018 version of Toast wallet enabled me to reset my password easily. 
From there, I was able to move on, generate my secret in toast, and import wallet into XAMAN (XUMM)

Last night, I lit a candle, poured a glass of whiskey, stared at my XRP bag and whispered, “You’ve ruined more dreams than my ex and the IRS combined.”

Then it hit me… XRP’s not a cryptocurrency—it’s a psychological experiment. A loyalty test. A rite of passage.

If you hold long enough, you don’t get rich—you transcend materialism. You stop checking prices. You stop feeling. You become one with the blockchain. Cold. Immutable. Emotionless.

Reddit,XRP,1k0jgs8,2025-04-16 12:42:35,"Emotions aside. Is it a dream or a possibility? Would it be possible for XRP to reach $5 by 2030 or am I dreaming here? 

Ps. Couldn’t ask this in XRP subreddit because everyone there’s is always going to the moon.","I don’t see why 5 dollars by the end of 2025 is unrealistic, tbqh.  If the economy normalizes, XRP is well positioned with the SEC case dropping, 17 or so potential ETFs and blackrock/fidelity maybe joining, and adoption from ISO.  

This is obviously a very glass half full take and a lot needs to go right but it doesn’t seem impossible ||| Crypto is usually fuelled by hype, and that has brought XRP over $3 in the past.

What is next for XRP is a mix of utility, derivatives, ETF’s and good old fashioned fomo.

What will set it off and when, is impossible to predict except for the insiders that start either the ETF or derivatives usage.

Ripples can kickstart the utility through their latest acquisition, and when that happens it will put 3 trillion $ per year on XRPL. This alone will drive the price much higher than the $5 you are asking.

People are generally not bullish enough ||| Realistically double digits per XRP ||| 5 would be lovely by July ||| It’s going to be $10,000 per coin and replace the Swift banking system by next Friday. I am 84,000% sure. ||| Some will say it's going to 0, some to 10K.

The objective truth, at this moment, is that anything between those two numbers is (still) a possibility, while both extremes are kinda (similarly) unlikely.

Wait for the end of July and (more) regulations to (probably) have a better picture. ||| I see it as absolutely being possible. The moves Ripple is making right now is just the start of the mass acceptance of the new financial system. We have 5 years until 2030. Plenty of time for this price to go up! ||| I think it will eclipse $5 before 2026 is over. ||| $5 by the end of this year sounds realistic to me. ||| It’s going to the moon. ||| $5 by 2030 wouldn’t even keep up with inflation ($5 2030 money would be less than $2.50 now) the way things are going lol. I think $10-$20 is realistic for 2030. ||| If it’s going to take 5 years to reach $5, this investment is no better than an average tech stock and there’s way better places to get returns on your investment. The only reason any of us are here is because of the imminence of institutional buy in. Look around you. Bipartisan Crypto legislation and regulation is finally taking place at an astonishing rate,  the SEC is backing off and reversing its predatory stance, the dollar, along with the market in general is being manipulated to usher in a global shift to a digital financial system, and Ripple holds the keys to the most efficient, cost effective, sustainable way of making it all happen. $5 by 2030? Try $5K, and that’s a conservative estimate. ||| Keep taking small gains over a longer period ||| [removed] ||| Possible, but not in this year or next year. ||| Maybe, hope this helps. ||| By 2030? If it’s not many multiples above that by then I’d be shocked.. anything is possible though ||| 100% atleast $5 by 2030 ||| I bought at 0,39 in 2021 so it's 5 times over in four years. You are dreaming of half of that gain in about the same period. A modest dream. Although the markets are not exactly the same, the Ripple universe is certainly bigger and bolder now. Of course, the usual disclaimer: never invest if you can't live or survive with an unexpected turn of events. Financial markets have that all in common. Gaining a lot means risk. ||| $5 by end of year I would say easy…2027 should definitely be over $20,  2030 upwards of $100. ||| 2030 is still miles away bud so anything is possible just don't hold your breath. And possibly look into sooner gains especially Cronos ||| Best way to see if it is possible. Take the total supply, about 100,000,000 xrp or 100B, and multiply that by $5 = $500,000,000. Do you think that the market cap of Ripple can be larger than Mastercard, Exxon Mobile, Netflix? Not exactly a direct comparison, but they draw some similarities. ||| >If the economy normalizes

Uh, that's a big ask. 

Either tariffs need to disappear... or we need to do 10y of factory building, workforce training, etc all in a year or two. And then we need to get used to paying way more for all these American made goods than we do for good from cheap labor countries. 

We essentially need to completely change the entire economy and.all our entrenched cost structures our housing etc along the way too. 

But once we do all that... its smooth sailing right? ||| finally, a realistic take in here ||| Double digits at least ||| I’ll have some of what he’s having 👆🏼 ||| How is zero a possibility?  With hidden road and and temenos and other companies that are planning to use xrp?  I know the private ledgers are probably a better choice for most institutional use cases however the public ledger is a cheaper smarter decision for some use cases.   Going to zero is not possible, imho ||| Dude are you good? Inflation is not 20% a year hahaha ||| I hope so.. because I’m seriously considering jumping ship after years of holding I’d rather just buy a car that I need right now ||| If I didn’t fuck my math up, capturing the forex market alone would warrant a 30 dollar price tag, that’s not taking into account supply and demand requirements as banks start to hoard them ||| People have multiple times debunked the market cap calculations for crypto ||| Thats not true for derivative markets. ||| Ahhh…we already have the factories, they need updated and refitted! ||| I don’t follow.  The issue is tariffs hurt investor confidence which disproportionately hurts speculative assets such as crypto.  

To regain confidence, we want predictability for our leaders and eventually China and the US will come up with clearer rules for how to trade with each other.  When this happens, business will adapt to the new rules. 

When we have a sense of the rules, we can make better decisions and invest more in capital to make things more efficient.  

So, on a microscale this is why the SEC case hurt Ripple so badly because investors were waiting for regulatory clarity.  This is now happening on a macro scale.  

We just want predictability so we won’t get burned by regulation changes.  This is why we need normalcy.  We don’t need tariffs to go away (although that would be nice). ||| IMHO, it's not possible either but it's easier to stay objective, and I guess there's always a 0.01% chance everything goes awry for some reason. ||| >Inflation is not 20% a year

Yet! ||| This is part of investing and making it through hard times. Not telling you to not sell, but only the people who can afford to keep their positions are able to succeed. That’s why it’s important to never put more money into an investment than you can stand to lose. Right now the people with disposable income are able to take advantage of the market and buy everything on sale while still holding. This will allow them to become even wealthier when the economy eventually rebounds. It’s a game of balance though because of those people buy too much on sale then they won’t be able to hold their positions. ||| Really? Please elaborate. Because math is math. ||| Please explain further. ||| Updated and refitted… yes. The huge capital investment part. And then we need labor. Americans work for American wages, which is why republicans wanted NAFTA to begin with... to avoid paying Americans those higher wages! ||| >To regain confidence, we want predictability for our leaders and eventually China and the US will come up with clearer rules for how to trade with each other.

You must not be listening very close to the White House and what they actually say about this (not coverage of the White House, but rather presidential tweets and their own WH press conferences). And you must not be listening to what investors (who aren't just on reddit here). Because if you were, I think you might be questioning your base assumption.

One week the tariffs are permanent and the cornerstone of re-shoring manufacturing over the next decade.

The next week it's about balancing trade with China.

The next week it's about Americans building iPhones in America with tiny screws (lol, Lutnick was fixated on the tiny screws).

The next week iPhones have alleged permanent exemptions from tariffs.

A different week everyone in the EU is ""ripping us off""

Oh hey this week everything is paused.for 90s days.

Another week they're again dead set on bringing all that manufacturing back to the US.

So what is it? It can't be all of that.

Or does the administration not really have a true goal here?

The market is starting to think this last one is the answer. And you cannot normalize to a ""new set of rules"" when the rules seem arbitrary and subject to change because they're not really tied to an underlying strategy. 2025 is redefining the term of a low confidence business environment. So until Trump changes his stripes or he's starting down the barrel of a deep recession and he blinks, things wont settle down. And people won't deploy capital. Why would you? You risk getting caught in the shifting winds. Shelter is the best choice.

Especially in a world where Trump is still talking bout firing the Jerome Powell and exerting more control over the Fed.

Especially in a world where treasury yields are going up despite market confidence going down and talks of recession seem very real. Treasuries are paying a slight risk premium right now. Let that sink in for a moment. 

This isn't your normal situation where markets will just ""settle into the new rules"" that are mildly different than before. ||| Exactly this ||| market cap can only be used to compare one crypto to another. comparing to non-crypto assets is apples and oranges. ||| Well your math is mathing but it is not a very useful tool when applied to crypto. ||| In derivatives you can gain exposure to the asset without affect its total supply. Derivatives market drives the insanity of the whole financial system. 

More on this subject here:

https://www.livescience.com/2990-thin-air-money.html ||| Stop with the political rhetoric…..go to Chicago talk to the unions then the non-union. Have you not heard of the Davis bacon act?….a professional, skilled worker sets the wage, not a elected official ||| I am having trouble understanding your argument.

In this post, it sounds like you think it is too big of an ask for Trump to clarify his trade stance by the end of 2025.  I think it is more likely the dick swing will be over by the end of the year but this definitely a possibility.  If this happens, the expectation is the markets suffer as a whole and XRP is included unless major announcements are made in XRPs favor. 

This seems like a reasonable argument.  

In the original post, it seemed like the entire economy needed to be restructured for XRP to grow.  This isn’t a reasonable argument. ||| To be fair, XRP and Ripple aren't a pure crypto. Its more like a corporation hybrid so I would say that it is a useful tool when applying it specifically to Ripple/XRP. ||| This isn't a political rhetoric man, this is what actually happened in reality. The professional skilled worker can set the wage, and the free market decides if it wants to pay them that wage…

The reason so many of those skilled jobs have gone overseas is because the free market decided it could get results cheaper elsewhere.  This is pretty basic stuff man... 

Not every idea that you disagree with is political rhetoric. Don't use lame excuse excuses like that.

Also, what in the world does the Davis-Bacon act have to do with what we are talking about? Have you actually read the Davis Bacon act???? it has a very specific limited scope, none of which is relevant to what we are talking about here ||| >In the original post, it seemed like the entire economy needed to be restructured for XRP to grow.  This isn’t a reasonable argument. 

That's not quite what I was trying to say. Was using speech to text so no clue if it came out as crisp as I intended.

If Trump sticks to his primary plan (Navarro's plan for permeant tariffs and re-shoring US manufacturing) then the whole economy will end up being restructured. Which means I think XRP growth is not something you should count on any time soon.

Which is a very different cause/effect chain vs ""the entire economy needs to be restructured for XRP to grow"" ||| And I would use your same arguments to say that it not applicable 😉😁 ||| And so the business goes elsewhere, places where the wages are considerably less because why? And yet the same populations go to U.S. for what reasons? Answer that man? ||| Dude, you're so off in left field that I dont even know how to respond.

Ask it to be objective and unbiased. Dont tell it which screen name is actually you and which side of this argument you're on.

I find it is a super helpful way to see if Im making sound arguments or have sound information, or if Im being biased. I use it for that all the time. And it doesn't have a emotional bone-to-pick like a guy like me on the internet might be. And it doesn't have a political bias. So maybe it will be easier to listen to ||| Dude, answer the question….

Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road is a defining moment for the XRP Ledger and XRP.

Reddit,XRP,1jq3n1n,2025-04-02 23:48:57,"RLUSD an ISO 20022 coin? I just read that they are trying to integrate RLUSD into ISO20022 compliance. 
My understanding had been that the XRPL is the highway and XRP is the car for cross border payments. But if RLUSD is also a car which is backed by US dollar deposits, bonds, and cash equivalents….. wouldn’t RLUSD become the tool for cross border payments worldwide? Kind of like the dollar has been prior to Blockchain?
Where does XRP fit into this? I understand that a tiny bit of XRP will be burned with every transaction, but I had anticipated XRP being the tool for cross border transactions. However, it now looks like it might be RLUSD, pegged at a dollar and backed by what I mentioned above. Can anyone enlighten me on this?","You’re right that the XRPL is the highway, and XRP is the native bridge asset built to move value across that highway..fast, cheap, and without pre-funded accounts. 

 RLUSD is more like a stable, dollar pegged passenger vehicle on that highway, useful for representing U.S. value, but not built for global liquidity.

XRP isn’t replaced by RLUSD…it’s activated by it. Stablecoins like RLUSD create more demand for bridging between currencies, and that’s where XRP shines. Unlike fiat pegged tokens, XRP is globally liquid, currency agnostic, and optimized for instant settlement.

And with its unique design, XRP doesn’t need a massive market cap to move massive value. It has a multiplier effect…one XRP can be reused over and over within seconds..making it an incredibly efficient tool for cross-border flows. 

So if anything, RLUSD makes XRP more relevant, not less. ||| I could be completely wrong here so do your own research and someone correct me if I'm misquoting anything.  

The ISO is a messaging standard so the ISO compliance is built into the XRPL.  XRP isn't ISO compliant because it's just a token.  

  
RLUSD vs XRP - RLUSD isn't a real threat to XRP.  It's able to do cross-border payments, but it is a lot slower and more expensive because it requires a lot more steps.  XRP is significantly faster because of the built-in pathfinding and requires a lot less manual intervention so it's a lot cheaper.  

The issue with XRP is that there isn't regulatory clarity, and I don't think people trust it yet.  I think RLUSD getting them into RippleNet is a big step forward and eventually they'll convert to XRP because it's a much better service. ||| Where does xrp fit into this  ? The same place it always has, to fund ripple the company.
Brad had said ""ripple wouldn't be profitable if it didn't sell xrp"" ||| If XRP doesn’t need to have a massive market cap to move massive value, that would seem to imply that we shouldn’t expect the price of XRP to go way up. Is $2 or $3 the ceiling — or should we expect it to go higher? ||| Yeah that's all that he's ever said. Nice highlight. ||| Good question..and no, $2–$3 is absolutely not the ceiling for XRP. Far from it. 

 It’s important to understand that XRP isn’t a meme coin, a stock, or a traditional “token” you speculate on hoping for hype. 

It’s a utility asset…a purpose-built bridge currency designed to eliminate friction in global payments. Its job? To replace the outdated Nostro/Vostro system, which still ties up an estimated $27 trillion in dormant capital just to facilitate cross-border transactions. If you’re unfamiliar with how Nostro/Vostro accounts work, I highly recommend looking into them …it’s key to understanding the problem XRP solves.

 regarding the price…XRP’s market cap multiplier is a real, data-backed from inflow numbers. Because XRP settles in 3–5 seconds and can be reused over and over throughout the day, it has an efficiency multiplier. 

 Ripple documentation and independent studies have modeled this anywhere from 10x to 70x, meaning $1 in XRP can move $10–$70 in value daily. So XRP doesn’t need a market cap equal to total daily volume…it just needs enough liquidity and velocity, and the price naturally follows utility demand.

If you’re curious…run your own scenario: take even a fraction of SWIFT’s daily flow (over $5 trillion), apply the multiplier, and you’ll see why XRP at $2–$3 is barely scratching the surface. 

This is about infrastructure level adoption…and the market is only just catching on. ||| I should also add….

 Also worth pointing out….banks and institutions don’t need XRP to be “cheap” to use it efficiently. 

 In fact, it’s quite the opposite. A higher price per XRP allows larger value to be moved with less slippage and lower risk, especially for high-volume cross-border transactions. 

 The higher the token price, the more value per XRP, which increases efficiency and reduces the amount of XRP that must be sourced on the open market…something crucial for on-demand liquidity (ODL) systems.

This is one of the main reasons XRP has long been dubbed “the banker’s coin” …because it was literally designed from the beginning with institutional-grade use cases in mind. 

 It wasn’t built for memes, hype cycles, or store-of-value speculation…it was designed to eliminate the need for $27 trillion trapped in Nostro/Vostro accounts by enabling fast, trustless value exchange between currencies.

That utility isn’t just a bonus..it’s the core function. And as adoption scales..price will naturally follow function and necessity, not retail hype. ||| > Ripple documentation and independent studies have modeled this anywhere from 10x to 70x, meaning $1 in XRP can move $10–$70 in value daily. So XRP doesn’t need a market cap equal to total daily volume…it just needs enough liquidity and velocity, and the price naturally follows utility demand.

Sorry for my late response but what do you mean by this? Does this mean that unregarding the XRP price, 1$ in XRP can move in cross border payments 10$ to 70$ daily? So if XRP is let's say 20$, is can move 200$ to 1400$ daily?

And is that even when XRP is needed for only 3 - 5 seconds?

So in my example, 24hours per day, 3 - 5 seconds per transaction, 20$ in XRP can only move 200$ to 1400$ daily?",17,13

I’m sure there’s more that other people can talk about better than me but for one thing: Imagine needing to send $10,000 to a person overseas. Would you send it in pennies or dollar bills? Or for a similar example that I’m just gonna dramatize to better get across the idea, imagine you as one single individual sending millions of dollars abroad for a transaction. Would you send it in $1 bills or $1000 bills? It would be far more economical to send it in the highest denomination possible, decreasing the time and cost of the transaction, even if it’s ultimately going to be broken down into $1 bills when it gets to its destination. It’s naturally way easier to transfer one coin than a million little ones regardless of the method or medium. This also decreases all the processing fees and such as the work required to make this transaction happen is minimal compared to the other way of doing it. The US government did something that follows this same sort of principle with its own currency during the Great Depression I believe; minting a small amount of unique coins or bills that were made to represent like $100,000 worth of gold for the express purpose of making fast, efficient, safe, and even easier to account for transactions between the federal reserve and banks while the economy was in disarray. 

Hopefully that makes sense. I’m not trying to convince you or anybody of anything by the way, I’m just trying to explain a little bit of the reasoning behind one facet of XRP to the best of my knowledge. RLUSD is like coins compared to dollar bills in the simplest way I can put it. Which sounds obvious at face value but there’s a lot more to think about than just the fact that the coins are smaller. They’re almost like the same currency but there are actually different benefits and use cases between them, RLUSD being like a bridge between XRP and USD like in the olden days how a $100 dollar bill would be translated into a bunch of silver coins. There’s an economical reason for the bill’s existence even though they seem to do a similar job. ||| This person's post does a pretty good job of explaining the value of using multiple chains

Not after all the other cases they've dropped and how confident Brad was that it was being dropped. ||| Ripple is celebrating a major win against the SEC. A big moment for the crypto market! ||| “Will drop”, is it already official or no? ||| Apparently they said they'll put it to a vote.

Does anyone know which string in the Toast backup is technically the Family Seed / Private Key that you use to import your Toast Wallet into Xaman / something else? I have tried copy and pasting so many of these different strings with no luck so far. I would assume somewhere in here is the key I need.

RLUSD market cap was around $57m for some time, now hovering at $135m.

I am not talking about if you are up right now and the value of your current crypto assets are more than what you bought in at, I want to know if any of you have actually successfully gotten the money out and made tangible money?

Edit - Saw someone else's comment and realised the above isn't quite true. I also own Ripple shares and the company quite frequently does 'buy-backs.' I bought my shares at around $21 and the most recent buy-back valued them at $125. They only take a small percentage each time (2.5% - 6%), but it does mean I've had like $15K of my original investment bought back for about $50K (previous buy-backs were valued in the low $60s).

Again, I can't call it profit par say as my overall investment is larger, but it is a healthy (partial) return. ||| I’m actually living off my profits now. ||| Everybody thinks they’re gonna be a millionaire over night thats whats wrong those posts.

In the past 5 months I haven't lost. Buy the dips. I have around 30% in cold storage. All of those I paid between 0.30c -.050c profits are in the mid-hundreds.

Never been invited to a circle jerk. I'm fairly sure I would decline the offer anyway. ||| Sub .20 bout tree fiddy ||| My 3K investment turned into 60K so yeah I’d say so. (I sold twice and bought more with the profit to achieve the 20x) ||| I actually have. I held 4800 tokens prior to November valued at around $2500. After trump took office and it went from the .50c range to the $3 range, I was able to take out my initial investment of $2500 and still have nearly $10k just from it rocketing that high. 

I still hold over 3k XRP and was able to spend/reinvest that investment into other things 

Truth is, no one saw that rise coming the way it did. I don’t believe there will be anything we can anticipate when it comes to XRP rising. Because institutions want to make the most money. And that means retail needs to be out. But, I do believe ripple solves a huge problem and it will be profitable.

However, if the other guy wants to take out his money that's a taxable event that will screw him at the end of the year.  Inversely, if I take out my 800 it's all tax free.  Follow me for more tax saving tips. ||| This is one of those long-term investments. I've been here since 2000 damn was it 15? Anyway it was back when it was 25 cents. And because they went through that whole thing with the government we had to let it just sit there. So if it gets higher than $3 congratulations to everybody. ||| A little longer. I'm up about 9X

I took out what I started with, so everything remaining is pure profit. Therefore, I'm not emotionally attached to the investment.

For example, I invested $1k... it went to $5k... I took out my $1k. The remaining $4k has since grown much more to $10k.

It's almost a given blast off ||| So have you actually taken money out or is it all still in the crypto? ||| How much did you invest and how much is it now? I wouldn't recommend selling it all but if you got a fair bit in there you can hedge your bets somewhat, with how volatile the market is sometimes you can skim a little off the top when it reaches a high point then wait for the dip to reinvest and get more tokens. Of course every action is a risk and you don't want to do that only to see it skyrocket beyond where you took the money out but if you got the wiggle room sometimes it is worth playing the game a little

Personally my rule is once I have made a fair bit of profit I take out my initial investment so there is no way I can lose more than I invested in the first place. then I keep part of it locked in case it takes off and part of it fluid to gamble on the dips ||| I have seen it and yeah I think it there is a good chance of making a decent sum off of XRP which is why I have invested in it, but every coin makes similar claims and I see you all acting like experts thinking that this will be your ticket to millions if you invest $1000 into it and I just have to wonder have any of you had any wins in the crypto space to back up your asserted expertise or are you all just punters who are hoping that this time this particular crypto will make you a millionaire? ||| I am sure those who invested in Doge would have said the same thing in 2021, I think now they are probably wishing they took the penny for a quarter deal.

Sometimes it is better to cash out when the winnings are there rather than to hold out for more only to lose it all. ||| RemindMe! 3 years ||| Did you always buy from one exchange or was it over a few exchanges ...because all you have to do is click a token and got to the bottom usually and it will give you an option to view your transactions for that token ..that way you van find out your average price ||| Sheesh Kabob ||| How is it bad?

|-|-|-|-| ||| 🤐 ||| They will  not issue anymore XRP to  the exchanges  once the new  banking infrastructure is up and running ...so once all the exchanges run dry that's retail finished..meaning me and  all the rest of you out there so get what you can now ||| None of the crypto currencies have actual value. For like 90% of the people there is no reason at all to be involved in it - **It doesn't work if it's not widely used in everyday life (people use actual money to make financial transactions)**. In this stage, if no more new people in the *game*, then it just collapses just like now (p0nz1). ||| Yeah I am always a bit more skeptical of those claims, I believe it is possible to make a decent profit on XRP but I don't think it will close to millions for the amount I have invested, maybe if you invested around 100K you might end up with a million but if you already have 100K to gamble on crypto you are probably already very rich or very foolish.

In regards to making sure I get my initial investment back it is not because it would hurt me much to lose it but rather because I know crypto is a bit of a rigged system where the rich pull the rug and get the profits and the poor who were fed false hope are the ones who lose, and I will be damned if I will let any potential losses of mine pad some rich assholes bank account. Pulling out my initial investment makes it impossible for me to lose. ||| Do you even understand what that is? What the utility of XRP actually is? Or did you just hear somewhere it has utility that no other coin offers and decided to gamble on that? ||| Who is ""they""? ||| Yep, totally logical and intelligent approach.  I definitely don't have 100k invested, but I have several thousand at varying amounts from .21 to .36

An amount I'm ok losing, but I'm definitely currently well above profit and even if it drops to .50, I'll still get out ahead. ||| I overheard a guy at the gas station talking to his invisible friend, so I definitely banked on that and ran with it. ||| Who the hell do you think ...are you living under a rock .....RIPPLE of course ..even a half brain person could have worked that one out its not friggin rocket science ||| Yeah thought that was the case ||| So Ripple is gonna hold half the supply and not sell it. Do you understand how ridiculous that sounds?

You must not know much about the new banking infrastructure.  

J.P. Morgan has moved over 1.5 trillion since 2020, using their own blockchain. How much has XRP moved since 2012? No need for the XRPL when the code is open source. Is XRP really the bankers coin?

https://www.jpmorgan.com/kinexys/index ||| There are other financial institutions all over the world ...WHAT U THINK ITS JUST GOING TO BE USED IN A SHITTY AMERICA COS ITS AMERICAN ...DONT FORGET THEY HAVE TO CATER FOR ALL  THE BANKS ..YOU REALLY NEED TO DO A LOT MORE RESEARCH THEN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF PRODUCT RIPPLE HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL ||| Correct, there are other financial institutions all over the world, and they aren't using the XRPL. ||| and you know that for a fact ....gtfoh ||| Looks like your precious XRP won't be purchased for the US strategic reserve. Womp womp lol!

Reddit,XRP,1j1v0p7,2025-03-02 16:40:21,"Xrp talk I’m amazed on just how quickly the market cap can sky rocket in an hour. Just look at the price.

Another side note. I see people still hating on trump yet he is the main factor crypto is doing so well and the last administration killed it. Yet the same people complaining about trump say nothing","let’s try the socratic method:

when was the SEC-Ripple lawsuit filed? ||| Well yeah, he's a nazi loving imbecile. Of course people still hate him. He could turn dirt into gold and he'll still be one of the most hated people to ever exist. ||| Keep licking his boot, because you can't spend crypto in a death camp. ||| You're conflating Trump as a person with what his words have done for crypto.  No matter how much we benefit, he's still an @$$ putting it lightly. ||| Weird how you wait until a rally to peddle your political crap.
Why didn’t you claim this last week when the markets looked bearish? ||| As a Canadian, fuck Trump.  
My money doesn’t matter if he invades. ||| https://preview.redd.it/xz7tcue86bme1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79edc2350ef48e5b547aacd6cd5bf196005f4efe ||| He included SOL.  Enough said. ||| Bullshit. 4 year liquidity cycle, not trump-monkey. ||| So you’re just going to ignore the tanking value that we’ve seen for months since he was elected because we’ve had a single spike? Are you a bot or a fool? ||| Even Gary Cardona's personal survey shows XRP.X is the preferred coin over all the other coins:



https://youtu.be/AsZOJaWCqE0?si=45GC1niCtdiQsM1M ||| He can take away what he gives. Dont trust the man who called zelensky a dictator and cuddles with putin ||| Lol don’t mind the crazies. Libs have overtaken most of Reddit and they’ll hate trump no matter what.

Edit: oh lord here they come ||| THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT! ||| Bcuz ppl are stupid that's why lol ||| I came here to say that. People still hating on Trump, but he's the reason for this recovery and jump.
Get real people and enjoy the ride. Judge on accomplishments and merit, not lack of polish and speaking skills.
The last administration was weak, and the world responded to that. ||| It started in 2018 pretty sure California sued first for being a security then the sec got involved a year after. Regardless it doesn’t matter. Who were the people going after ripple? All liberal hacks. Gentler liberal AF. Elizabeth Warren liberal af ||| Someone still sniffing Biden/liberal bums. Take them shades off go outside and actually learn a little something ||| Best president of all times. America first whether hard ship in short term or not. Bet most will change their tune by beginning of 2026. ||| Why? Because he said mean things? Because he said stuff Maybe you and a small majority doesn’t like? It doesn’t even have to be him. He’s just the one that was elected and is doing something. Of course it’s going to make some mad. Who cares. You can’t make every single person happen. We don’t live in a fantasy world

I’m not completely disagreeing with you. I think he says some dumb shit but everyone does at times. I have never met someone who I think is perfect and agree with every. Single. Thing

Back to crypto…..how about these gains ||| I didn’t join this group until recently. But thanks. I was banned on /Xrp because I gave a projection of what I thought the price may be by the end of the year ||| id start lubing up with maple syrup now ||| invades lmfao good one man. it will be ok just put your mask back on and watch your news no ones is invading your canada ||| Thank you for a laugh. ❤️ ||| I think you are a fool for just posting that crap. The tanking is trumps fault….. get real 

Let’s say it is. Still going to hate him and keep your mouth shut for the crap the last administration has done for crypto ||| zelensky shut down churches arrested priest arrested men trying to flee stopped elections turned all media to one state run media should i go on oh wait no point because i could go on and on and you people would listen. but sometimes its fun to give you facts to cry about ||| Liberals called trump a dictator. Explain why the techie left are now talking with trump or two of the biggest left supports are talking too/ working for trump. It’s because the left have gone too far left. . Explain why the corrupt medias are failing. Explain the lies they spread. Explain all the stuff they tried to hide or say was mis information and then now it turns out to be real ||| I'm so sick of the ultra liberal whiners on here that I'm about ready to just delete my Reddit. ||| ![gif](giphy|f9eYHQ8RZ4zfc4unXx) ||| It was higher before he entered office, but okay…. ||| Holding strong at low 50s approval rating. Majority of people like what’s he’s doing. I mean. People will always hate. I don’t like everything trump does. ||| Lmao, swing and a miss kid. Don’t worry, you’ll get em next time ||| Actually it ties back to the whole etherium/hinman bullshit. Was done to hold xrp down and help ether explode. ||| you’re a fucking moron. look at the date of this press release and who was president at the time. then look at the second link and guess who was president when hinman was nominated.

i’ll give you a hint, it’s the same fucking person.

https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2020-338

https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017-97#:~:text=The%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission,Mr. ||| You would suck off hitler if it drove crypto prices up ||| The guy whose whole political opinion is based on how politicians affect crypto is telling people to go outside... ||| Go lick boot somewhere else man. ||| Yeah, look how well he unified Canada! Even the Quebecois hate him so much they’re singing the national anthem.   
  
The world is laughing at America. ||| You’ll be singing the same mindless tune while we all suffer under a historically inept administration, no doubt. ||| “Mean things” lol. Dawg it’s not 2016. Nobody gives a flying fuck about trump saying “mean things” anymore. People don’t like trump because he’s using rubes like you to toe the line so people focus on the last line you wrote while he sells us out. Enjoy your spoils while they last. ||| I don't want to make it political but we can start with the recent claim Ukraine started the war, ignoring the Budapest Memorandum which started as the Lisbon Protocol architected by H.W. Bush and signed by Bill Clinton, arbitrarily firing 1000's of people then having to hire some back because like I said arbitrary. 

I'm way up in crypto and today boosted my holdings even more and I understand it's due to Trump.  My gains don't stop me from seeing reality.  Siding with Russia and lambasting allies that have sent troops to every one of our military sorties, and what I mentioned before is not good policy. ||| For someone who claimed to not have a political bias in another post, you sure come across as a boot licker. ||| So, one week later, how do you feel about this thread and your projections? ||| Ahh yes, the “I’m rubber and you are glue” defence… Real big boy energy here. ||| Im from switzerland and i dont trust someone who is cuddling with a mass murderer and dictator.

In switzerland we dont have the rotten 2 party system.

The ETH free pass speech does smell like corruption to me, but that doesnt change anything i said. ||| Trump literally said he would be a dictator one Day One… ||| Just treat most Reddit comments like a zoo. Observe and learn their behavior from a distance but do not interact or feed them. If you engage with them, you’ll get dumber. ||| Honestly they've ruined this platform. ||| You may end up just getting banned instead. I was all I posted was a disagreement. Nothing nasty and I was banned on a group ||| I’m not disagreeing. My years may be off because I got in in 2018-2019. I stand by with my comment ||| …if you had been around back then there was a LOT of hopium that gensler might have unfucked the situation and given clarity, based on lectures he had given as a professor (they are on youtube).

sadly that was not to be the case.


i think the efforts of your limited braincells are better spent learning that it’s not actually a democrat/republican struggle that you are on the wrong end of… it’s class warfare. the banking dickheads needed to preserve their hegemony

all that said, trump is a fucking moron and cannot be trusted to reverse his position in an hour, a week, a month, based on whoever has talked to him last.

the only confidence i have in this sticking is the fact that B-rad is rumored to be on the crypto council ||| Idk about that the whole comparing hitler and trump blows my mind ||| You know what they say about assumptions. I don’t have a political leaning. But I also don’t have an issue with trump. Especially blatant lies media has said/hid. But I hope
Life treats you will living in a lie ||| Canada is a joke. Trudeau is an even bigger joke. The world is laughing for the media but they know with the money supply cut off, they will be hurting ||| They care. And you’re mad at someone making a profit lmao. Aren’t you trying to make a profit? ||| What recent claim? There’s always a deeper reason for why things are happening people don’t know about or just plain refusing to see. Left or right

Scratch that first question. I’ll find it. I’m moving from away from politics cause I’m sure it’s against the rules ||| and you come across as a pedo voter but hey whos counting ||| Pretty sad you came back here. But great. Bought more at a discount the good news out ways the bad

My original post still holds. This administration is still doing more for crypto than the last. Can’t control what whales and people who want to get rich over night do and then panic when it doesn’t happen I just buy the dip and hold ||| Proves my point on that fact that you probably
Don’t know what’s actually happening. I don’t even know what’s actually happening. But I will not trust any media because of the past lies and misinformation they’ve spread. They are struggling to survive. I think that explains enough

Also hope to visit Switzerland sometime. Its gorgeous ||| And so did Bobby bones and yet people love him. He says stuff knowing libs with go crazy ||| oh i guarantee im banned after my rants tonight i was just tired of seeing people call you a boot licker so i let loose on them. ill be back in three days hahahahaha ||| but i live in hawaii so they can ban me all they want i will just walk down to the beach and laugh it off, its like ground hog day here every day is 83 and sunny i dont let these clowns keep me down ||| And I’m not disagreeing it was by liberal hacks ||| Right. Trump is temu dollar-store “we have hitler at home” hitler. Trump is a fat lazy draft dodger and hitler was a hardened street brawler war vet. Not praising hitler here just in case anyone is confused. Just bagging on magat jesus. ||| Yeah. Mussolini is a much more apt comparison. ||| If you can’t make any comparison between the third reich and Donald trumps administration then you aren’t paying attention. It doesn’t have to be 100% the same to be fascist ||| If you don't have an issue with Trump you aren't paying attention. You don't care that he's glazing Putin while throwing Ukraine and the rest of Europe under the bus as long as your coins go up? ||| This is why Trump loves the poorly educated. ||| Ooof this guy is too smooth brained to understand what’s going on ||| lol sure buddy… ||| Trudeau has stepped down mate… Does boot taste so good that you genuinely enjoy the taste or is this more of a “my daddy licked boot so I do to” sort of thing? ||| [deleted] ||| Sight... let me guess: elon actually speaks the truth? 

If you defend trumps handling on the ukraine war, youre so far gone, i wont even try to have an actual discussion with you. Sorry. ||| *slurp slurp slurp*  
Sorry mate, I can't hear you over the sound of your bootlicking. ||| Oh I don’t care. When someone literally take the time to find every message and comments on it like he did he obviously has issues ||| Saying you’re not praising hitler doesnt negate the fact that you praised hitler you dumbass 😂 ||| Thanks Susan ||| Then who is someone who tries to censor or blocks anything and anyone that has a different opinion?  I don’t want to see the excuse “ we can’t have misinformation spread” let people decide what to believe if they are dumb enough to believe bs let them ||| That’s completely false, people are just seeing it that way because of their blind hatred for the man ||| No, that’s not what’s happening. 

There is a level of delusion amongst European leaders that Russia is bad despite the Ukraine conflict being instigated and supported by the CIA since 2014. Trump is putting an end to that fraud and it’s time for everyone to catch up on reality.

Unfortunately, the EU thinks it is NATO and will suffer due to their own politics. ||| Interesting…explain cause the last 4 years was nothing but uneducated. 

How about these gains. I hope you’re enjoying them ||| So smooth any rational thought slides right off. ||| I guess the left should have done more than. Sorry buddy ||| Actually he is still PM as of now ||| Typical left response but ok. Enjoy the gains let’s profit together. I still love you ||| so you dont like trump trying to stop people from dying good to know. or is it you wanted him to be like biden and just keep sending billions to a guy that cant account for 100 billion dollars. trump has said he wants all people to stop dying i know thats hard to hear for you tds people. or are you mad he didnt let someone come into the white house and bad mouth us. maybe uk will pick up the tab now. but we wont be sending any of our troops to that war nor should we ||| Show me where I did ||| You really have one brain cell, huh? ||| Did you even bother to watch his tantrum in the Oval? ||| I care about more than crypto gains. But even if that is your single issue - XRP price was 3.10 on Jan 20th when Trump took office. It’s 2.42 right now. So I’m not sure what gains you’re referring to unless you bought in the past 24 hours. ||| The left should have done more about your obvious political leanings? ||| Typical boot licked response… When confronted with discussion, you dig deeper into Trumps musky ass ||| Look what 2014 and 1939 happened. Appeasement didnt work back then and wont work now. Stop being delusional, putin got his way in 2014 with the krim and made his move in 2021. ||| I guess. I would think something better could have been said. But that’s about all that haters will say. Uneducated, one brain cell, stupid, not smart. Etc ||| Then sell. If you hate the guy that much sell. It was .40 cents for years. All liberal haters. The dip was deeper than just because of tariffs. Big players selling to cause a panic to then scoop up more. They are playing the game. ||| You must be new. Price started spiking after trump won the election and Gary Genslar announced his resignation. Trump also ran on a pro crypto policy which boosted the market sentiment. XRP was running around 50 cent and jumped up to 3 dollars around that timeframe. ||| Hey now that’s not very DEI of you. But it doesn’t apply to people who have different political views I guess ||| well he did say not to join nato and nato surrounded him inching closer and closer then ukraine tried to join. im not saying i agree with putin but it goes both ways i do know putin is promoting orthodox churches giving young families farms and pushing for them to have kids while zelensky is shutting down churches and arresting orthodox priest shut down elections and turned all media to one state run media arresting men trying to flee the war. go look at nato countries in 2014 then look at them for 2020. un troops going around raping women i dont blame him not wanting them near his country. then throw in the us bio labs in ukraine you keep poking a bear eventually you wake them up ||| You don’t know what I am holding or not holding. And clearly you don’t know that Trump has no constitutional authority to create a federal crypto reserve like what he is promising to do today. Are you a billionaire from your crypto yet? Because that’s the only way you could get Trump and his cronies to give two shits about you. ||| Does your memory go past 5 years ago? Or did you jump on the bandwagon in 2021?

Xrp is older than the Biden and Trump Admins lol. ||| Based on speculation. But Trump has floundered all of that since getting in office. That’s why we should attribute his impact to the crypto markets based on when he took office, not what people thought he might do beforehand after the election results. ||| Like everything else you said that doesn’t make any sense. ||| The war is going on since 3 years, there is no way to change your mind, as you are too stupid to understand basic diplomacy between sovereign countries.

I wont waste my time with shit like that ||| Doubtful. I guess the talks of the dividend checks going out to everyone because the left abused tax payers money isn’t caring. What do I care if he’s a billionaire. He made his money. Work hard, eat good, sleep great, Spend right rinse repeat. Generational wealth. I may not be a millionaire or a billionaire. But my
Kids kids will be. Gotta start somewhere ||| No he hasn’t. XRP is currently up over 300% in the past 6 months. Not only that, but he’s adding XRP to the strategic reserve, and reforming the SEC. XRP has NEVER been in such a bullish position than it is right now ||| Another typical liberal response to deflect. Have a good day sir ||| If you think you’re getting $5k from the government based on the lies around DOGE savings, you’re dumber than I thought possible. The actual savings from them completely gutting the functions of our government comes out to about $53 per taxpayer. ||| You can just ya know… be happy? Try it ||| Explain the lies? I mean sure the numbers MAY be off. But any kind of waste and abuse should make everyone mad. There is zero percent chance our government doesn’t abuse our taxes we spend 

I’m sure your numbers are 100% accurate. I’ll start listening to you now ||| Trust me I am. Life is great ||| They’re eliminating entire agencies unconstitutionally to save a few billion while proposing $4.5 trillion in tax cuts to people making $400k and up. Make it make sense. ||| Another lie. It is entirely within his power to do so. Saving is saving literally what the majority of the us wanted. Several hundred billion over 4 years is a lot. They’ve been spending this several hundred billions for years which is why we are at 37trillion ||| And the deficit increased more during Trump’s first term than under any other president when accounting for time in office. Are you paying attention or not? ||| Another false narrative. Did you forget Covid which was bipartisan, you say 8 trillion. People that actually do research with say about 4 trillion. On top of that give it a year or two. Bidumbs unlimited spending will far exceed trumps. ||| He was on track to do that based on the tax plan alone, before Covid. But keep believing whatever the right wing media tells you. ||| Is that why the left wing media(90%) of are just trying to survive. But you know what you’re right……",0,141

Reddit,XRP,1iz3vl8,2025-02-27 01:17:45,"How would a higher market cap be supported? I'm still learning here and this is an honest question. 

If I'm understanding correctly; the Ripple network and XRP are meant to facilitate payments, largely bypassing the expensive and cumbersome SWIFT network.  That sounds great.

But if XRP is meant to facilitate and process payments among peers and financial institutions, and not as a store of value, won't most users only hold XRP for a few seconds, just enough to facilitate their transaction?  It means most of the time, the value of XRP should remain stable and there should be no point when the price skyrockets. 

I know a lot of people are hodling XRP and hoping it'll hit the moon.  My question is why would it shoot up in price if its use case calls for quick in-and-out transactions most of the time?  It seems that for transacting, a stable value would be preferable.

What am I missing?  Those of you who know Ripple better, please enlighten me. ✌️","[removed] ||| Good info here ||| Because according to Goog the daily value of global SWIFT transactions is around $22T. So the amount of XRP available to the system would have to be substantially higher than it is today. A mere 8x increase over its current value ($2.18 per token = $127B market cap) would only give it a $1T market cap. You have to also remember that a lot of the XRP will be held offline or in personal wallets and not even available to the system to use.

So what im expecting is a face melting rise in value to whatever predetermined value our dear leaders have already determined will be required for the system to operate as desired, and then it would remain relatively static +/- a few %.

And considering that it might possibly become the new major global payment system, I don't think a $10T market cap (80x its current value or about $100 per token) would be out of the question. ||| WHEN it comes to crypto : Market price is purely just the current price of times the supply… so a big part of the answer is just that if people are willing to pay more, and there is more buy demand than sell demand the market cap will increase. ||| Wait i can earn money with my XRP apart from the intrest? Where can i get more info about this? ||| To paraphrase the long vanished Galgatron, ""It's cheaper and more efficient to transfer 1 XRP worth $1 million than it is to transfer 1 million XRP worth $1.""",14,12

Please edit the post and remove the backup file info ||| [removed] ||| Don’t trust any dms, be wise. ||| NOW! Do that NOW! ||| It's a mimic text. It's not real. This is an analogous version of what I have. I stated this in the post. ||| You don't mention the passphrase.

You used TOAST wallet in 2017 didn't you?

That looks like a toast wallet backup. Am I wrong? ||| Yes, correct. The words/keys don't match for a full access account, however. ||| You can reset your passphrase 

I have an old installer version of Toast Wallet.
Been on my external since 2018. That's what I used when I faced this issue. 



You should be able to reset your passphrase with just your backup phrase.


Afterwards, you should transfer your coins to XAMAN wallet. Toast hasn't been supported for years now sadly 

NB : Your passphrase must contain one number and one symbol. If you can't remember, don't sweat it. ||| I tried the Toast wallet on GitHub, didn't work for me as they needed the Old passphrase to reset. ||| Can you tell me the version you have that works?

Reddit,XRP,1ip16e5,2025-02-14 03:14:20,"XRP and Stable Coins I just posted this on my other account but here goes nothing haha. 

Xrp (I can’t post on there not enough Karma) please read.

Q:So why XRP will do well? 

A (My theory): USA is moving towards stable coins. We have printed to much cash and don’t have anything to back it up. We want to move back to gold, assets, and essentially bitcoin. The way we do that is make stable coins. These stablecoins can be backed by real-world assets (such as USD, EUR, or commodities) and traded on the decentralized exchange (DEX) within the XRPL. Also they are backed by USA treasury bonds. XRP is the bridge. XRPL supports the issuance of stablecoins and other digital assets through its built-in Issued Currencies (previously known as lOUs). This allows financial institutions, businesses, or even individuals to issue stablecoins on the XRP Ledger. Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution uses XRP to facilitate instant cross-border payments. In cases where stablecoins are used for settlements, XRP can still serve as a bridge asset to enhance liquidity and enable efficient transfers between different fiat and stablecoin corridors. The XRP Ledger has a built-in DEX, where users can trade stablecoins against XRP and other assets. This allows for fast and low-cost conversion between stablecoins and XRP. 

EX: Imagine a financial institution issues a USD-backed stablecoin on the XRPL. A user in Europe wants to convert that USD stablecoin into a Euro-backed stablecoin.
Instead of finding direct liquidity between USD-stablecoin and EUR-stablecoin, XRP can act as an intermediary, making the transaction faster and cheaper.","Remember, there was a time when gold and silver certificates were backed up by something other than faith. I have absolutely no faith in the government whether it be left right or center. As soon as this president is out the next one will retract everything and when this one is done vice versa. So, I think your prediction, assumption is a good one. Bitcoin is too slow. It’s only purpose is to save assets. Whereas XRP, as you stated serves purpose. All of this is going to come to surface within the next few years. Those who do not see the value in XRP are going to wish they did once it hits record highs. However, I think it will always be a utility coin and never a stablecoin, so its price will be volatile. Still, I plan on putting everything I have in a cold wallet and not touching it. I’ll hand the keys over to my safe on my deathbed with my seed phrase to my daughter. Trying to accumulate whatever I can. But until then, I’m going to enjoy the next 30 or so years.

The quickest mammal on Earth, the Cheetah,  can reach a speed of 100km/h in under 3 seconds. A McLaren 765LT with a price tag of over a half a million USD, does it in 2.8 seconds.

When the Cheetah reaches its peak acceleration, it can only run for a few seconds more by which time, it will have expended so much energy, that it takes the poor cat over 3-days of total rest to recover from the dash. 

If it doesn't catch the Gazelle it set about to hunt, the torment of those three, or more, days will be coupled with the excruciating pain of hunger.

Yet, the Cheetah will keep going at it until a Gazelle falls victim to its speed and agility. Therefore, I don't think the thought ever occurs to the Cheetah if it will, or will not feast on the Gazelle - it simply hunts without regard for hunger, failure, or success.

I see hundreds of posters on various crypto communities commenting, and seeking advice, in a mad panic, about whether to sell their coin(s) or not because they're anxious about the ""crash"" of one coin or another, or the whole crypto market, and whatever else that bugs them. 

Maybe, said good folks, should consider if they're suited for the ""hunt"" or not!?

In other words, if you're not prepared to ache in every part of your exhausted body, and potentially go hungry for 3 or more days, maybe you should consider not hunting Gazelles!!

Why get into a boxing match with Mike Tyson if you're not prepared for the pain?

And if you decided to get in the ring for a round with Mike, why ask the crowd how or when to get out?

Reddit,XRP,1ii3s6n,2025-02-05 06:21:07,"What is the advantage that XRP has over other cryptos? I am trying to understand the utility that XRP has over other cryptos. I see a passionate community but I cannot wrap my head around it.

Bitcoin is a safe store of value due to its decentralisation, PoW, and 21 mil cap.

Ethereum already has a big defi ecosystem.

Solana is user friendly, great trx rate, low fees - this comes down to its single-state design and PoH.

What advantages does XRP have?",">What advantages does XRP have?

XRP is cheaper, faster and more decentralized then every chain you just listed.  XRP Invented DEFI, having the first DEX and stablecoin back in 2012, built into the layer 1 protocol itself. Back before DEX's or stablecoins were even terms in the space.  

Nothing moves value from A to B faster or at a better rate then XRP.  Now you might read that and go so what you can go wallet to wallet, but you misunderstand what im saying when I say Value.

XRP has ILP and multi bridge currency swaps built into the protocol.  You can setup your wallet so that all incoming payments get automatically converted into whatever you choose to hold.  Dont wanna use XRP? No problem have incoming payments get swaped into USD and BTC 50/50.  How about you want to hold some stock? no problem re-allocate 10% of all incoming payments get converted into the stock of your choice, or bond, or Oil, or Gold/silver. All of which are traded on the XRPL atm.  XRP allows you to Transfer, and convert Whatever you have that has Value, and pay someone who might not even accept that form of payment and they get whatever ""value"" they want to receive.  That is the power of moving Value from A to B.

It also has many other advantages/utility.

Firstly its Deflationary, so Unlike BTC (which is dis-inflationary) or ETH (which can be inflationary or deflationary depending on the time of day)  XRP is always getting destroyed.

XRP is immune to 51% attacks.  The system is designed to be very resilient and strong, so much so that the concept of a 51% attack, isnt possible on the XRPL.

Network validators arent directly incentivized.  Since Validators dont earn a fee for doing the work required to uphold the network (like in BTC for example where Miners earn a Fee and can censor users from their block if they so chose to)  the XRPL says the best incentive is no incentive, There is no dictator of the block like in BTC. Nobody wants to gain control of the network or even attack it because there is no reward for doing so.  The people who value having a strong decentralized network, pay to run the network and build their business/operations off of it. ||| We use it for work for international payments. It arrives at the seller in less than a second and a tiny fraction of what the bank would charge for a international payment ||| It’s made to functionally replace SWIFT (detailed explanation is a biiiit longer) ||| Bitcoin is often seen as “digital gold” because people use it to store value, but it has some big issues…it’s slow, expensive to use, outdated, and bad for the environment. A single Bitcoin transaction in 2025 uses as much electricity as a U.S. home does in 46 days because its system (called Proof of Work) requires a huge amount of power to run!

On top of that, Bitcoin can only handle a small number of transactions at a time, which makes it very slow. When too many people are using it, the network gets clogged, and transaction fees go up. That means you either have to wait a long time or pay extra to get your transaction processed quickly.

Meanwhile, utility tokens are changing the game. These tokens aren’t just used for buying and selling, they actually do things within their blockchain networks. They can be used for services, voting on decisions, or earning rewards.

Blockchain technology in 2025 is improving very fast. New methods like zero knowledge rollups and Proof of Stake (PoS) are making transactions cheaper, faster, and more energy-efficient. Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-hungry system, PoS uses way less power, making it a better long-term option.

Another big trend is tokenizing real world assets (like real estate, stocks, and supply chains), which could grow into a $2–30 trillion industry. This means blockchain isn’t just about crypto anymore, it’s becoming a huge part of the global economy. Which BTC was never designed for, or capable of. 

In short, Bitcoin is outdated when it comes to speed, cost, and energy use. That’s why utility tokens and new blockchain technology are gaining momentum, they provide more VALUE and are being adopted across industries at a fast pace. 

But as always, do your own research before making any big decisions. ||| You're gonna hate me saying this.

But there is one thing xrp has over other cryptos and that's ripple.

But I’ve been in XRP since nearly the beginning, and one of the original differentiations was that when other early coins were pointedly made to disrupt traditional banking and fiat, Ripple was designed and promoted to be extremely compatible and useful with fiat. 

So besides the technological underpinnings, there was a major attitude difference as well. ||| One advantage is that Ripple is actively networking across banks, insittitutions, governments and with other crypto projects as well… 

At first BTC people were so anti government / anti system…. But now they just want government to buy BTC reserves 

Ripple is well positioned with RLUSD, and they hold a lot of XRP… only BTC ETH and XRP have been in the top 10 their whole life 

XRP is extremely fast / cheap, and more than that : ripple has been getting so many banking and financial licenses across the globe…

They are well positioned for tokenisation, and despite being criticised as ‘the bankers coin’ for a long time… now it seems everyone wants the banks to adopt crypto and bring fat stacks of money…

Tbh its dumb people are so competitive and tribalistic… 

A win for XRP is a win for all crypto... Same with ETH and SOL 🤷🏻‍♀️ ||| The biggest advantage XRP has over all other cryptocurrencies is RIPPLE and its HUGE war chest of funds. 

Ripple has more money than anyone would ever need. They have 1000+ employees that are all the cream of the crop. They are laser focussed on growing the XRP system. They are transparent, they are honest, they are GOOD PEOPLE. 

It blows my mind that people believe and state that RIPPLE is bad. RIPPLE is what makes XRP and the XRPL what is today and gives it the potential it has. 

It was BTC devs that created the XRPL. YES people that worked on BTC saw way back then the limitations of BTC and created a new blockchain that was more advanced in everyway.

Any BTC maxi must find it hard to understand that the XRPL was built by BTC devs as BTC 2.0. ||| It’s smort ||| To put it simply.

I just posted this on my other account but here goes nothing haha. 

Xrp (I can’t post on there not enough Karma) please read.

Q:So why XRP will do well? 

A (My theory): USA is moving towards stable coins. We have printed to much cash and don’t have anything to back it up. We want to move back to gold, assets, and essentially bitcoin. The way we do that is make stable coins. These stablecoins can be backed by real-world assets (such as USD, EUR, or commodities) and traded on the decentralized exchange (DEX) within the XRPL. Also they are backed by USA treasury bonds. XRP is the bridge. XRPL supports the issuance of stablecoins and other digital assets through its built-in Issued Currencies (previously known as lOUs). This allows financial institutions, businesses, or even individuals to issue stablecoins on the XRP Ledger. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution uses XRP to facilitate instant cross-border payments. In cases where stablecoins are used for settlements, XRP can still serve as a bridge asset to enhance liquidity and enable efficient transfers between different fiat and stablecoin corridors. The XRP Ledger has a built-in DEX, where users can trade stablecoins against XRP and other assets. This allows for fast and low-cost conversion between stablecoins and XRP. 

EX: Imagine a financial institution issues a USD-backed stablecoin on the XRPL. A user in Europe wants to convert that USD stablecoin into a Euro-backed stablecoin.
Instead of finding direct liquidity between USD-stablecoin and EUR-stablecoin, XRP can act as an intermediary, making the transaction faster and cheaper. ||| Nothing. XRP has no intrinsic value whatsoever. Not even the decentralisedness of BTC. It's the purest of speculations. ||| Thank you for the thorough explanation. I’m going to read up on these things. ||| Your explanation is excellent. 
I've read so many explanations and yours makes the most sense. 
If ripple can make a simple Ripple wallet/app where someone can deposit fiat/crypto and convert to say Tesla/apple stock or exchange say dollars for euros and then send to another wallet via xrp. 

Question. Ripple the company control the supply and could make more? 

Is a ripple wallet in the works? ||| Please explain how ""deflationary"" is a positive attribute? Isn't the whole point of currency to be transferred? If the portion of the transaction of fee is constantly being burnt then at some point we'll come to a point where spending XRP would basically break the economy of a small country, so naturally everyone would hold onto their XRP in perpetuity. ||| XRP is more decentralized than BTC - lmao

Even ETH is more decentralized. Ripple holds too much power over xrp for it to be truly decentralized and theres still fuck all nodes in comparison ||| I don't understand white people try to praise XRP as decentralized. At the end of the day it really isn't. If one person can control it then it's not decentralized. Are we trying to redefine decentralized?


Also, you ignore the fact that Ripple holds half the supply. You want to talk about inflation....


The amount of XRP destroyed is a red herring. Do the math. Look how many transactions happen daily right now. Let's pretend everybody in the world switched to XRP. Now let's double that number. Now let's do the math on how much XRP would be required to maintain liquidity for every single one of those transactions. It's almost nothing. It's a very small fraction of the total supply. Banks will never need your XRP. ||| You use xrp already? What’s your industry? ||| And what do you do to turn it into fiat/cash? ||| Thank you. That makes sense. It’s not competing with those other cryptos in the first place. ||| Thanks for the thorough write up! 


Which coins/block chains are being used to tokenize real world assets? ||| Ha I do hate that but it seems to be XRP's trump card.

There was a deleted comment which pointed out that Ripple can convince banks to use it as a settlement layer. ||| Solana is currently processing 1,200 TPS right now and has a theoretical limit of 65,000.

XRP is currently processing 20 and has a theoretical limit of 1,500. ||| Yeah, please remind, which is the internet of the 90s, 2000s, etc lmao 🤣 ||| >If ripple can make a simple Ripple wallet/app where someone can deposit fiat/crypto and convert to say Tesla/apple stock or exchange say dollars for euros and then send to another wallet via xrp. 

not only is that already developed, IIRC it has been deployed(and not by ripple). Fairly certain that is https://anodos.finance goal.

>Question. Ripple the company control the supply and could make more?

Ripple doesnt control the supply anymore than michael saylor controls the supply of BTC.  They can't create more as the same limitations (and some additional ones) which limit BTC to 21 million, limited XRP to 100 Billion in 2012.  Every day that number falls a tiny bit and has continued to do so since june 2nd 2012.

>Is a ripple wallet in the works?

was already deployed and discontinued as that isnt their main focus.

IIRC there is https://anodos.finance/ which either recently deployed or is about to deploy which does this. There is also Xaman wallet(formerly Xumm wallet) & Bifrostwallet. and a few others that do what is needed. ||| > Please explain how ""deflationary"" is a positive attribute?

Supply vs demands relationship to price.

What happens to price when supply falls but demand remains the same or rises? it goes up, meaning for the investors, XRP being deflationary is a benefit.

> Isn't the whole point of currency to be transferred?

That is the point of a traditional currency yes. This isnt meant to be used/replace in the traditional commerce way though. Like nobody is saying buy your coffee with XRP!  Now thats not to say it cant or wont ever be used in that manner, just that isnt the focus. Its completely possible and as far as crypto is concerned it does excel in this manner.  Its strength tho lies in its ability to swap value A for Value B mid transaction.

So say you own a coffee shop/store, you could have customers  pay in XRP (OR anything of value) and mid transaction it can get swapped into XRP, then into whatever you want to receive. Say you have a coffee bean supplier in brazil so you need Brazilian Real to pay them, set it up so that 25% of all incoming payments get converted into that and the rest into US dollars. Viola now you can pay your supplier in the currency they want to receive saving you time and money as a business owner.  Its stuff like that happening all over the place which is exciting to me.


>If the portion of the transaction of fee is constantly being burnt then at some point we'll come to a point where spending XRP would basically break the economy of a small country  so naturally everyone would hold onto their XRP in perpetuity.

not in your children's, children's, children's, lifetime will this be an issue.  The ledger started in 2012, we started with 100 Billion. We currently are now down to 99.9 Billion around ~13 years later.  Its such a small amount of deflation that its almost irrelevant.    Also the fee/burn amount can be raised or lowered via Votes on the validators.  Right now you can do around 8000-10,000 transactions and you only burn around $0.01 of XRP to do so.  

There is an issue of how the Velocity of ""money"" affects its value which many have speculated would be a problem for XRP, but with so many verticals being possible in ""payments"" I dont see it as an issue, its not like Gold which really only has limited manufacturing implementations. Someone somewhere will always want to Transfer Value from A to B. ||| > XRP is more decentralized than BTC - lmao

How many mining pool operators colluding together is required to 51% attack BTC. Now do the math on XRP. let me know when you learned something.

>Even ETH is more decentralized.

with the swap to PoS you have no way to know this. How much ETH does vitalik/lubin/consensys hold? You have no idea.

>Ripple holds too much power over xrp for it to be truly decentralized

Ripple has no power over XRP.

Show how they can doublespend

Show how they can reverse transactions

Show how they can create more XRP

Show how they can censor a user from the network

Show how they can force a code update on the network.

The only ""power"" Ripple has, is the ability to shoot themselves in the foot the most.  They hold the most, meaning they gain or lose the most by the price rising or falling. and with most of their holdings in timelocked escrow, they have tied their own hands up willingly.

Also, Try not to use a logical fallacy when forming an argument. use practical or theoretical examples and evidence/sources. a ""no true scottsman"" fallacy as your main argument just makes you look daft. ||| Yeah first time we used it would’ve been 2018, marine/fishing industry between New Zealand and supplier in Canada.

The demo also showed a transaction from fiat to btc and a few others. All I could think of when I first saw it was why is this not a global standard.

GPT4o


You're hitting on the core issue with XRP’s decentralization debate: it’s not about whether the XRP Ledger (XRPL) can be decentralized, but whether the way it's currently structured effectively makes it centralized in practice.


The Decentralization Argument


XRP Ledger is, on paper, decentralized because:


Anyone can run a validator.


The ledger operates on a consensus protocol instead of proof-of-work (like Bitcoin) or proof-of-stake (like Ethereum 2.0).


Transactions are validated through agreement among independent validators, not a single controlling entity.




The Centralization Argument


However, the way Unique Node Lists (UNLs) work creates a practical centralization issue:


Ripple publishes a recommended UNL of trusted validators. Most network participants use Ripple's list or a very similar one.


While anyone can run a validator, it won’t matter unless they’re added to a widely accepted UNL.


Ripple and a few partners hold significant influence over which validators are recognized as “trusted,” meaning they have indirect control over the consensus process.


If banks or Ripple-controlled entities dominated the UNL, they could effectively filter transactions and exclude participants, creating a system that, while technically decentralized, is functionally centralized.




The Key Issue: UNL Governance


Theoretically, the XRPL could be made more decentralized by distributing validator influence more evenly. But as it stands:


1. Ripple's influence over the default UNL makes them a gatekeeper.




2. If major financial institutions become the dominant validators, they could impose restrictions that mirror the traditional banking system.




3. The governance model makes it easier for Ripple and its partners to coordinate control in a way that’s much harder on a network like Bitcoin, where no single company has that kind of sway.






Final Thought


You're right that the term “decentralized” is being used semantically. XRP Ledger is decentralized by design but in practice operates in a way that allows Ripple and large institutions to exert control if they coordinate. It’s not outright centralization, but it’s certainly not the same level of decentralization as Bitcoin or Ethereum. ||| Do you send on Coinbase? ||| It’s worth looking into for sure. They’re doing some pretty wild stuff over there ||| XRP transactions do not require approval from a central authority or a third party. They are processed and validated by the Ripple network, which operates through a consensus mechanism. This is different from traditional proof-of-work or proof-of-stake systems.

In the Ripple network, validators agree on the validity of transactions, but they do not ""approve"" them in the way that some centralized systems might. The validators work together to ensure that the transaction is legitimate, and once a consensus is reached, the transaction is considered confirmed and added to the ledger.

However, the network itself is decentralized, and as long as the transaction follows the protocol, it will be processed without the need for explicit approval from any individual party. ||| central authority is probably why governments would be more inclined to use it that makes it worth more ||| Can you explain how it stopped working? ||| It didn't crash. It halted. It's a security measure. ||| If you don't know its decentralised then don't assume it isn't. Just do a quick search buddy. ||| Why is that a problem? ||| > They can have influence on the validators.

The only way Ripple can influence/attack the network is the same method used to attack every other decentralized network (aka this works for BTC as well) anyone can use words/arguments, monetary incentives, laws/regulations/bans, threats(physical or other) or any other method they wish to use in an attempt to pressure participants to change the system's rules to their gain.

> The point here is even though it has the option to be decentralized, in practice it also has the option to not be decentralized. The simple fact that reality exists means it's not truly decentralized. 

""no true scottsman fallacy"" Try not to use a logical fallacy when forming an argument. use logic, evidence and sources. It's decentralized.

>You're hitting on the core issue with XRP’s decentralization debate: it’s not about whether the XRP Ledger (XRPL) can be decentralized, but whether the way it's currently structured effectively makes it centralized in practice.

It's about what can be proven to be true and what is utter nonsense.  I gave you a short list of basic examples which would give your argument a valid concern if proven to be true. The problem is that none of those examples are possible because the network is decentralized and your premise was wrong from the get go.

>However, the way Unique Node Lists (UNLs) work creates a practical centralization issue:

>Ripple publishes a recommended UNL of trusted validators. Most network participants use Ripple's list or a very similar one.

Anyone can publish a UNL, Ripple doesnt even publish the dUNL or default UNL now. Anyone can change any validator on their UNL to any other validator. Ive run my validator since 2018 and still to this day have zero Ripple validators on my UNL just to prove a point.  The reason for the default list is to get the user in sync* with the network right out of the gate. its a lower barrier to entry for people who are just learning the consensus protocol.  Everyone has the freedom to change it to anything they like at any point later on.

>Ripple and a few partners hold significant influence over which validators are recognized as “trusted,” meaning they have indirect control over the consensus process.

>If banks or Ripple-controlled entities dominated the UNL, they could effectively filter transactions and exclude participants, creating a system that, while technically decentralized, is functionally centralized.

You just very loudly announced that you dont understand what validators do or how they function. Please explain by which method would a validator exclude a transaction to censor a user.  Walk it through from start to finish, lets say Ripple runs 100% of the validators for the network. go from start to finish how do they exclude my transaction? (I cant wait to hear how much you dont understand)


>The Key Issue: UNL Governance

They KEY issue is people like yourself who dont understand the topic speaking with any sort of authority.

Ill give you an example.  Ripple created an amendment called the checks amendment. It would allow an address to freeze all incoming payments to their own address, Unless they pre-approved the transaction.  This is so banks/FI could do KYC/AML to deposits prior to them being in the bank/FI's wallet.  Ripple spent a lot of time an resources coding this, promoting it to the network as a ""good"" upgrade and guess what happened when they sent their code amendment proposal to the network?   Every voted no (even Ripples own validator in the 1st round of voting voted no) it took them almost 3 years of changes and having to speak to all the validators and listen to their concerns and issues with this amendment (most of which were around data storage for this new payment type) thats 3 years of my validator and many others saying ""no""  to Ripple directly. 

This example illustrates/highlights how much ""control"" they dont actually have and why you should try and actually understand the topic instead of just spouting off nonsense.

>Theoretically, the XRPL could be made more decentralized by distributing validator influence more evenly. But as it stands:

Again Ripple has the exact same ""influence"" as everyone else on the planet.

>XRP Ledger is decentralized by design but in practice operates in a way that allows Ripple and large institutions to exert control if they coordinate.

No it doesnt and you've failed to provide a basic example with some logic/sources/evidence to back that claim up. you've just announced that you need to do more reading on the topic because you misunderstand what is being said.

-edit typo* ||| Nah I actually use Hitbtc for my business transactions ||| Do you think it’s better than XRP? /Are you splitting money between the two? ||| Sorry man but you are either being dishonest here, or you are simply talking about things you don know very well. 

First you say that there has never been a crash, less than a day after XRPL halted for 1 hour, than you claim that XRP is decentralized, when the truth is that it is very much centralized. 

The validators might be distributed around the globe, but every transaction NEEDS to be confirmed/validated by a central entity. This is very much evident in how the whole system stopped working yesterday because the central entity no longer validated the transactions. ||| There was a ""halt"" or an ""outage"" for about 1 hour yesterday on the XRPL network, pretty much less than a day from your comment :)  
I don't have any further information than what has already been posted about this issue on various sub-reddits, here for example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/XRP/comments/1ihv6id/xrpl\_halt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/XRP/comments/1ihv6id/xrpl_halt/) ||| A crash is completely different to a halt over transaction concerns. I'm not sure you understand this yourself to be quiet honest. All validators are independent from ripple bar 1. So out of 80+ one is an actual ripple employee, making xrp and the xrpl decentralised.

If you still don't understand, maybe stay away from this space until you do. ||| OK I didn't see that. But I don't see how this is a bad thing. Solana crashes for up to 18 hours at a time due to heavy traffic.",65,111

Reddit,XRP,1idsiqt,2025-01-30 17:37:42,"PSA: Accessing old Rippex wallets from modern command line I recently needed to recover access to some XRP wallets from ~2017-2018. I had the wallet files and the passphrases used to secure them. I think these were made with an old client called Rippex, which was discontinued many years ago, and it was not clear how to access the wallets without it. I also found that many other people have encountered this issue, and it comes up semi-regularly.

In principle, recovery is possible because the Rippex wallet encodes a seed key which can be imported to a modern wallet, which can then do transactions with the coins as normal. So, running Rippex and opening the wallet file will allow export of the seed key. Unfortunately, Rippex is not distributed now, and the only links I found to the installer looked highly suspicious. Compiling and running from source also proved challenging. Other recommendations suggested using Toast, but this has similar problems. According to their X account, Toast shut down in 2020.

I looked at the wallet file and noticed it is base64-encoded JSON, in a format that contains a ciphertext and detailed information about the cipher and settings used to produce it. This in turn was apparently generated by a cryptography library called SJCL. This library has not been updated in 6 years, but is still available and works. You can install it with

    npm install sjcl

This did not work at first. Then I learned by looking at comments on the Hashcat forum (https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-10020.html) that the password gets reformatted prior to use in sjcl. Here is some source code that uses SJCL and the password modification to decrypt a Rippex wallet file.

    // decrypt.js
    
    // npm install sjcl
    const sjcl = require(""sjcl"");
    const fs   = require(""fs"");
    
    // 1) Read the base64-encoded JSON file
    const [,, walletFilePath] = process.argv;
    if (!walletFilePath) {
      console.error(""Usage: node sjcl_decrypt.js path/to/base64_wallet.json"");
      process.exit(1);
    }
    const base64Data = fs.readFileSync(walletFilePath, ""utf8"").trim();
    
    // 2) Decode base64 into JSON
    const rawJson = Buffer.from(base64Data, ""base64"").toString(""utf8"");
    const walletObj = JSON.parse(rawJson);

    // 3) Prompt for password on stdin
    process.stdout.write(""Password: "");
    process.stdin.setRawMode(true);

    let password = """";
    process.stdin.on(""data"", (chunk) => {
      // keep reading characters until the user hits enter
      if (chunk.includes(0x0d) || chunk.includes(0x0a)) {
        process.stdin.setRawMode(false);
        console.log(); // newline

        // 4) pad the password and decrypt
        try {
      // actual password format is ""len|password"" where len is the password     length
      // eg. the password 'notyourkeys' has length 11, so the formatted     password would be ""11|notyourkeys""
          password = password.length + ""|"" + password;
    
          const plaintext = sjcl.decrypt(password, JSON.stringify(walletObj));
          console.log(""Decrypted wallet contents:"");
          console.log(plaintext);
        } catch (e) {
          console.error(""Decryption failed:"", e.message);
          process.exit(1);
        }
        process.exit(0);
      } else {
        // Append typed characters (no echo)
        password += chunk.toString();
      }
    });

Once you have node/npm/sjcl installed, this code does not need network access, so you can run offline if you like.

How to use it:

* Install node and npm in whatever method is appropriate for your OS.
* Run `npm install sjcl`
* Copy-paste the above code to a file called `decrypt.js`
* Put `decrypt.js` in a folder with your wallet file (let's say that's called `my_wallet`)
* Run `node decrypt.js my_wallet`
* Type in your password when prompted
* If you typed in the right password, it will decrypt the wallet and print the results to the console as a JSON string.
* The key (long string starting with 's') and account ID (long string starting with 'r') are in the output, listed as ""masterkey"" and ""account_id"" respectively.

Supposedly you can plug that into other wallets and get access to your coins from there. I make no recommendations or endorsements about this, but I will say that I believe Xaman will support import of your recovered wallet by taking the key as the ""Family Seed"" in the import menu.

I'm infodumping this in case anyone else runs into the same problem. Hope this helps folks.","I will confirm that Xaman will properly import with the s key in the Family Seed field. I just did so successfully last month, to my great relief. ||| Good info here",9,2

I have a basic working knowledge of block chain but don't really understand how another token working on the XRP or any other block chain affects the price of XRP in this case? I just watched a video regarding a future euro digital currency and need to know more!,"The XRPL ledger is a way of making XRP transactions publicly, immutably and free of censorship (kind of), without trusting a central bank. This part is no different to BCH or LTC.

Anyone can set up a token on the XRPL and the tokens move around the network in the same way as XRP. If the ECB was to set up an EURC (like Circle's) backed with real Euros it would be as good as Euros and a little easier to transact than traditional banking. The ECB would have some censorship and clawback ability.

XRP would still be needed as a base reserve on wallets and miniscule transaction fees. It may also actually as the currency of liquidity, but not necessarily. ||| So ripple the company is main contributor of xrp ledger .  In short, not to be too technical The xrpl ledger is where all cbdc would be connected and convert from euro to US dollar or euro to yen etc.
Now the use of xrp is not necessary to do this conversion but the fastest way is to use XRP so it would convert from euro to xrp then xrp to dollar for example.
However, again xrp is not necessary required but if this happens then it will burn 0.00001 xrp per transaction if I am correct.
Also the higher value for xrp the better because imagine bank want to transfer 1 millions euro they will need 300k plus xrp today for this transaction. If all play well and all partner with ripple use xrp ledger it will be massive for xrp price because also tokenisation is possible and that use xrp as well. an example in Europe is to check LCX which is basically Lichtenstein they are tokenising lot of asset on xrpl that burn xrp every time they do it.
The big deal now is cbdc is forbidden in USA but banks can connect to xrpl directly as well like Bank of America did in the past.
Ripple partnered with hundreds of banks but what I think is all banks are awaiting for sec lawsuit to finish or settle for good in USA before to make any move, however somehow it seems in October this year swift and most of bank seems to have discussed to go live with cryptocurrency based ledger but everyone is speculating which crypto it is. Could be any of iso20022 token like xrp,xlm,hbar,algorand,xdc and few others. This are the utilities of cryptocurrency and banks has been testing it since 2013 and this year the entire banking system is going to use cryptocurrency for transferring money arround the world because it’s cheap and fast and combine this with AI agent you get best trade for the money at low cost for the bank but bank will still charge you the same price ;) ||| This makes sense but how does this ""greatly improve the price per xrp""? Or does it at all? Obviously it would be great for ripple and the reputation of xrp but would it directly increase price? ||| Thank you for this explanation. ||| Anyone using the CDBC in their own wallet would need to buy the reserve XRP and a little transaction fee XRP. The increased demand would push prices up. ||| Each stable coin issued via the XRPL has the ability to be swapped to any other asset via its native DEX/AMM. So there could be multiple pools where you could contribute your liquidity for fees.

To break this high XRP would need to be at around 23.82$ while BTC remains at same value. This would put XRP market cap at 1.382 T. Dwarfing ETHs market cap but still way behind BTC market.,"Probably a controversial take on this sub but I personally think it would be quite unlikely while we are in a speculation phase, which I personally think we will be in for at least another cycle. If Ripple achieves its utility goals for cross border payments using XRP, then I think it would be likely for XRP to break its XRP/BTC high, and quite possibly one day even flip BTC for market cap. My feeling is that we are quite a long way from that ever happening but damn would I love to be proven wrong! ||| XRP's price is currently driven mostly by speculators. To see it gain significant market cap, it needs to gain significant adoption and usage in it's designed, intended role: the business of transferring large sums between different countries/currencies.

What are the obstacles in the way of XRP being adopted and used as designed and intended? There are probably more issues than I am aware of, but what I see as some of the bigger issues are:  

* The SEC aggravation needs to be put to bed once and for all. Everyone is hopeful that this is imminent.  
* Then across multiple jurisdictions, there will likely still be further bureaucratic red-tape to navigate (laws, rules, regulations, policies, etc). If it involves a legislature or regulatory agency, that can be a very slow process. Some locales may be easy in this regard. I rather suspect most will be a slog because of the way that governments typically are. This step holds risk of monkey-wrenching (ala the SEC's maliciousness, the potential for SWIFT leveraging global political connections that it's spent decades developing and grooming, all that sort of bureaucratic tyranny and oligarchy-esque bull-butter).
* Then the banks themselves have an I.T. effort to implement the option for XRP within their bank systems. Even though Ripple has a published API to assist implementers, there still needs to be design, development, testing, training, documentation, etc and every step along the way likely requires meetings, consensus, decisions, approvals, QA checks, and on and on. 

I don't see it like flipping a light switch everywhere, all at once. I tend to think adoption & usage will come on gradually/regionally. Even if the biggest institutions were to have everything in place and ready to go, they may still hold off until smaller institutions have a quarter or two of actual usage to report -- sort of a , ""This looks great!! But you go first!"" attitude. 

Even faced with all that, Ripple/XRP is staying the course and doing what they can to keep it moving forward.

Thanks in advance","I think you should stop immediately to tell other people how much you own of whatever it is that you fancy. ||| DYOR. XRP is owned by Ripple Labs. Investigate thoroughly, and you will discover- for yourself and by yourself- that there is no other token/coin that has its tentacles in as many companies as Ripple Labs does. Google ‘Brad Garlinghouse meets with’ and see how many companies around the world he has been making deals with. Read the XRP Whitepaper. Read it again. There is no better long-term play than XRP. It is THE bridge currency that works with ALL other currencies, fiat and crypto, moves money in any amount, anywhere in the world, in 5 seconds or less, and does it for $0.0002 percent per transaction. Do the math: when every single transaction in the U.S. alone could total around $846 billion, calculate how much 1 XRP token must be worth to support that number. Your result will be somewhere between $10,000.00 and $35,000.00 per XRP token. Now, sit back and ponder that- then make a wise decision. Again, Do Your Own Research. Find. YORX Superior Trading on YouTube: he is an analyst, does his own research, and, after watching his videos for two whole years, I have seen his predictions on many, many crypto-related actions actually become reality. In other words, he can be trusted to give you the straight story. He provides proof of what he is saying. Also, when the BIS- Bank of International Settlements- the Central Bank of the rest of the world (other than the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank), mentions XRP and  XLM in their own documents- what more evidence does one need to realize the right choice? I recommend you invest in XLM & XRP, sit down, strap in, and hold on. By 2030, you will be so very glad you did this. Also, HBAR, XDC, QUANT, LINK, are all very good bets.

The new digital reserve really is just about BTC and XRP. And they'll find out soon enough that BTC. Even with lightning network, is still too slow against XRP. 

I still stand by what I said before that XRP won't have parabolic changes until 2027.

I told you 😀 ||| The difference is preliminary adoption. I.e Banks aren’t using HBAR for internals.. and exposure.. you don’t see Dotan having dinner with Trump.

Not to mention, the unprecedented domination in the case against SEC.. 

Ultimately, there are a lot of projects that do similar things.. but it’s the road they pave to get there. ||| So with the banks, it’s regarding instant transactions. What also comes into play and also separates XRP from others like ‘HBAR’ is the networking involved. By networking i mean Ripple have worked incredibly hard to gain the trust and establish solid relationships with these financial entities.

It’s not the same protocol but a much quicker one. 

On top of this, Ripple also have the support of a community because they were the first crypto company to beat the SEC, paving the way for any future law suits.

Ripple have loyalty from their supporters.. like millions of supporters that stuck by them through the whole ordeal.

Networking also comes down to making connections with the likes of Trump and Musk, two of the most influential people in the finance sector on the planet.

Ripple have laid a ton of ground work to lead this race.. and it will pay off. Not just for ripple but for all of us XRP holders that have stuck by ripple from the start.

They also hold the most licenses for payment service providers, making them the number one company to be able to facilitate the needs of the financial market. ||| Well regardless I’m in both. A lot heavier in xrp than HBAR but HBAR seems to be on the same pattern this bullrun. Can’t go wrong holding these 2 atm. Trying to figure out my exit strategy to take some profit before a crash but it’s really difficult because we’re kind of in unprecedented times with xrp. If there was no SEC case xrp would have had price action ages ago and we would have a good idea of where we should technically be at in price. Now that it’s over and we finally moving I don’t think anyone knows where this stops. I just don’t want to be anyone’s exit liquidity. ||| What’s THE NEXT Layer 1 Ledger token in the making?

I noticed a few days ago that all of sudden there no shares available. Messaged EquityZen and was told Ripple is restricting all these sales at the moment. Any one have any guesses why? I've seen similar actions when companies want to go prep for IPOs but don't think that's the reason. 

Edit: just learned the reason why. Ripple is doing another tender. They will buy back up to 5% of outstanding shares at $125 a share for those who participate. Gives them a rough valuation of 22 billion","A buyback is massive news for a private compy!

It's an indication that they're confident in their future... and anticipate an increase in future valuation. They may also be buying up voting power to push for an IPO. ||| I know on Linqto they are available for a short while, then they stop selling for a while.

None of these coins act like typical securities (stocks) in that they are usually decentralized, used as currency, not dependent on a CEO...not sure how Gensler stretched this whole thing out?

They've earned my business for life. ||| Credit or debit? .makes a difference! ||| I disagree ||| Are you putting in an actual order that is getting filled or are you just going buy now?  Buy now will fill from sell orders available so can end up being higher than the price you might see which is often the last sold price - sometimes exchanges charge a lower fee the larger an ordee as well - your time does not seem worth the 7c you paid extra (3.125%) … depending on how you paid your card might be charging you a fee, or some sort of tax might be added to the exchange fee... Make sure you understand what you are paying before complaining too fast… tbh fees keep exchanges up and running so ideally you want them running well funded 😅 ||| Why does it honestly matter if you are never going to sell? ||| Tell me you don't know anything about spot prices without telling me you don't know anything about spot prices.

It is the same with all commodities including gold and silver.   There is a spot price for buy and sell and then there is the actual buy price, which is higher, and an actual sell price, which is lower.   What you see is the spot price, not the actual buy and sell price.  But that's OK, quit using uphold and make negative posts saying a company is a ripoff while you are the actual ignorant person who doesn't understand it.   Perhaps next time you should consider asking a question or doing some research before making false accusations.  🤔 ||| You have to limit order if you straight buy you will always buy market price, ooofffff…. Has nothing to do with anything other than you now knowing how to use the app. Robinhood same way, Coinbase same way….. limit, market, ask prices all mean something.. ||| I trust uphold as an American based exchange, however I do agree that when you buy or sell instantly the prices are not what is quoted as the value when you hit buy/sell. I would suggest you use limit orders. I used to use Bitrue and on there you could actually see what the bids were and what would be reasonable when you place your order. I will say this after over leveraging this year, glad it has worked out, I do appreciate on uphold that I can withdraw money instantly to my debit card. ||| Limit orders fix this issue ||| Limit orders fix this issue ||| the dreaded ""spread""

It’s been a while but I was only paying the inflated price. No extra fees besides that. ||| That's what the spread is.

When you buy crypto on a CEX, you get hit with a fee and spread. Typically both a percentage of your cost.

Rest it out (for your own sanity) with a small amount first. It usually takes about 2-3 min for faster cryptos like XRP, Algo, XDC etc. it can take up to 10-15 min for BTC.

Yeah, fuck that shit lol... ||| Appreciate your feedback and help 🙂🤝 ||| I was going to use simple swap but in my case I didn't want to swap anything, when going to the buy section, it wasn't showing XDC as an option 🫤


However I found this site on the XDC website for cross chain:

Which led me to:

It worked perfectly for buying and using my XDC wallet address, straight to cold storage 🙂


Thanks for putting me on track with simple swap, definitely will come in handy later on 👍 ||| No dude. You are confusing Coinbase advanced for Coinbase pro. Advanced is free with lower fees. You have to select that version in the app. Regular Coinbase charges higher fees to be simpler for newbs. ||| Bro, do an easy Google search... Im literally talking about CB advanced. Not the pro...

The higher the tier you in, the more they take I guess... They won't let me see the tier cause I'm not logged in...

Advanced is free. The fee works different than most with a fixed rate... 

You are being tier listed depending on the volume you trade or amount dollars you have in your account... ||| Alright yeah. I have not really found any better.

i brought xrp in 2017 times, stored it in my toast wallet (offline) thats been on my pc ever since, today i tried to open my toast wallet but for some reason there is no app or file etc ? i have all my original ID, Phrases, Recovery Key everything. 

  
is toast wallet still a thing, or is my XRP just gone forever now ? is there a legit place to re-download toast wallet without getting everything yoinked 

  
any help appreciated.","I was in your boat. Used my Toast wallet recovery phrase in Xaman and all is good. ||| Toast wallet no longer exists. Watch out for the scams pretending to be them. You put your recovery codes in and then your XRP is gone! ||| Dont share your seed :) People might dm you. Ignore them they are most likely scammers. ||| Use all that data and import it into Xaman. Xaman is a highly trusted wallet.

Be aware, DO NOT use any toast wallet these days. Many, many of them are malicious versions that will steal all your coins and tokens. ||| thanks for all the help, for anyone in the future who may see this threat, using xaman was the best way to go and the most simple.

  
you download the app (android or iphone) directly from google, no fishy links. 

  
'recover wallet' function within the app, then use your 'secret seed' from your original ripple wallet, and put this in the 'family seed' tab within the xaman recovery stage, this will then bring your ripple id up if you have done it correctly, and there you go. ! xrp now stored and readily accessible + 19 extra, if you are like me and made your original wallet when it cost 20xrp to make it :) it now costs 1xrp so they return the 19 extra, a nice suprise.

  
good luck, and hopefully xrp keeps going strong <3 ||| So can I use my tw seed phrases on xaman ||| Just input your wallet address and private key into the xaman wallet and your funds will be available, I had the same issue with some old 2017 xrapid wallet ||| Still got the old app in my phone for nostalgia :o)

Also the tipbot app :o) ||| Glad you kept your recovery info!  Definitely sounds like Xaman is the way to go based on these comments.  Good luck getting your XRP back! ||| What if my paper wallet don't have phrases. Only password, SC and file ||| Did you get this sorted? ||| Is anyone able to help me out. Im in the same boat. Ive believe I have all the information, im trying to use xaman with no success ||| What about all the comments and reviews for xaman saying they wont let you export funds, also the reviews are all posted 3 years ago or seemingly on December 1st-3ed.  seems very bot like, how can i trust this app? ||| FYI to oldies Xumm became Xaman ||| appreciated the comment brother, and then once in xaman, you have no trouble moving back and forward into exchanges etc ? random question, when i first brought xrp it was 20xrp to open a wallet, is that still the case ? or if i recover to xaman will i get some xrp back (if they have lowered it) ? ||| thank you, is it easy to import ? it doesnt cost another 20xrp to open does it ? and i can transfer from there to anywhere else can i ? ||| I'm thinking of buying Ledger Nano X. Why do you think many of them are malicious? How can they steal coins? ||| secret seed = family seed in xaman this worked fine for me, i now have all my xrp + 19 extra as they reduced the amount required for wallet creation, originally it was 20, now its 1. ||| Yes, if worked fine on Xaman :) ||| Sorry for slow reply, it seems to be sorted I can see everything and the price, but obviously have not transferred to sell just yet .. ||| as long as you have your 'secret seed' you just recover that using the 'family seed' function on the xaman wallet. its the same thing, type your secret seed in that when 'restoring' and it will bring up your ripple id and then you know youve recovered it correctly. ||| Hmmmm, I’ve not tried to transfer funds to be honest, as my Coinbase was playing up, so maybe it’s worth testing with small amount ? But in terms of wallet recovery showing correct funds and a ‘legit app’ that seems to the be one everyone was recommending who actually seemed legit ||| This confused me for a second when I was going around to different wallets to transfer the 9 newly liberated XRP in each of them to my Ledger ||| ![gif](giphy|1MavtKlrGG9Mc) ||| Only 1 XRP is required for the account reserve. That means you'll have access to.19 XRP that you previously didn't.. that's like $50 at the moment! ||| My Xaman is showing 1 XRP reserved and the rest are available for spending. ||| No, it’s 1 XRP now for reserve. They switch it a couple days ago from 10 XRP. ||| If you're going to hook up your old account then you don't need to spend the XRP to open as new wallet as, I assume, you still have some XRP or at least the old minimum/reserve there. An important point to make since you're from 2017 - the minimum/reserve XRP for an account went down to 1 XRP so you'll get a few of your XRP back now for you to use.

In terms of difficulty, it's been a few years since I imported my toast wallet into Xaman (used to be called Xumm) but I found it easy enough.

EDIT: To be clear, when you import your phrases or recovery keys into Xaman you get access into your old XRP wallet. It's the same one as before as the wallets 'live' in the XRP ledger and not in toast wallet so you don't open up a new wallet. If you really want a new one you can open a new one up but since you have all your old data you can just get acesss to your old wallet. ||| In regards to Toast wallet, the original developer stopped supporting it. Due to that, it opened up a gap for malicious people to make copies of it and there's even many online web fakes of toast wallet.

They make people put in their seeds or recovery phrases, load up the wallet and transfer out the coins/tokens.

Ledger is a reputable company so Nano X is fine. ||| Are you talking about still using Toast? ||| appreciated brother :) thank you. ||| thanks for the help i will have a look, i take it this wallet is app based only and not website based ? my plan was get it off a wallet and into coinbase (which is now also being akward) ive had so many people send me different links and sites so trying to work out the best way. it sounds like using this app is probably the way forward. yes i just want to use my recovery stuff to open my existing old wallet :) thanks. ||| No you have to use xaman :) ||| Yes, it's app based. iOS and Android. 

Whatever you do - please, please do not click links anyone sends you. Just go to get Xaman yourself (no links) and get access to your old wallet there yourself. You cannot trust anyone who sends you a link.

  
Be safe and good luck. ||| you the man, i will look into this and thank you for your guidance. :)",45,44
Reddit,XRP,1hefqp4,2024-12-14 23:40:49,"Has anyone ever transferred XRP to and exchange using the XRPDelete method before? 1) was it Kraken?
2) did you use correct destination address and destination tag?
3) was the exchange able to connect the funds to your account?
4) how long did it take?
5) is their anything else you can tell me about your experience?

Thanks.

UPDATE
Kraken did me right in the end and even though they don't support XRPDelete, they assigned the total value to my account. It was quite the experience but they assured me it's not normal for a case to take so long to resolve.","If the XRP didn't show up in your account in the normal amount of time (usually a few seconds to a minute or so depending on the exchange), you'll have to contact the exchange's support, unfortunately. Just create a support ticket (or whatever they call it on Kraken) and explain what happened, who you are, your Destination Tag at Kraken, and be sure to provide them with the transaction hash to expedite the process because they're going to ask for it. 

The issue is that most (maybe all?) exchanges aren't setup to properly detect `AccountDelete` transactions and credit the appropriate customer. They simply listen for successful `Payment` transactions with a valid Destination Tag and pretty much ignore all other types of transactions. Assuming you input the correct deposit address, the XRP is definitely in the Kraken account but just hasn't been credited to your account yet because their system ignored it. They can manually fix this via a support request. ||| Where did you do the AccountDelete transaction that didn't warn you about sending it to an exchange? ||| Thanks a lot i appreciste your time. That's what kraken support say...manual fix but they say it may take weeks or months. They are very vague and unhelpful for estimated processing time or assurance ill get my funds but the tag and address were definitely correct as I sent further xrp using same destination address/tag  (not using delete function) and it arrived successfully. ||| Hi and thank's for answering.

Ledger XRP Delete toolkit. Im going through it again, and yes, there's a message

""Proceed with caution!This operation deletes the account rEmFNLN...uTx16Jf and can only be performed if all requirements are fulfilled. Use a non-custodial wallet like Xumm or Ledger Device as destination. **Do NOT use an exchange as destination!""**

I have used the method before to transfer from wallet to wallet, so I didn't think about this, but in my opinion, crypto punishes (potentially irreversibly) you for human mistakes.

I was more focussed on getting the destination tag correct because I get that an exchange has one (or a few) addres(es) shared between their customers, so the destination tag fixes that.

I have potentially lost 4208 XRP because of this, and its annoying because it did arrive at Kraken, but they are just dragging their feet about it because I made a mistake.

I just want to know if someone has been through my experience. I don't care if it takes 6 months - so long as I get it back and Kraken are being vague about how long it will take.

But guess what, they did offer some internal trading fee waiver for the current value of XRP. What am I going to do with over $10k of waived trading fees? I suppose I could day trade with leverage and just keep guessing till I make that 10k back...

That is what annoys me becaause if they were not sure the XRP was mine then they wouldn't offer to buy it for their internal waived fee...I guess that gives me some confidence that they will return it at some point...


UPDATE
Kraken has now allocated the funds to my account.

They do not support the XRPDelete method, so be careful when trying to claim every last bit of XRP in your wallet. Just leave the minimum amount in there!! ||| Damn that's a long time for such a simple request that will ultimately take someone a few minutes to correct.

Reddit,XRP,1hcqz8s,2024-12-12 17:57:32,How will RLUSD affect the price of XRP? Let me first start off by saying I hold XRP and im bullish on XRP. This post is not meant to be FUD its just to further my understanding. I understand that RLUSD is meant to be a stable coin which it backed by USD. Im just wondering how the XRP token is tied into all this? If its the Ripple Ledger or blockchain please explain how so. Thanks.,"I think we’re all in the same boat as far as no one really knows what will happen when RLUSD is launched. The one thing we do know is anything on the xrpl runs on xrp, meaning every transaction will burn xrp in the background

As far as price appreciation your guess is as good as mine brotha. I personally think xrp can reach $10, $100, $500 and long term $1k if everything aligns for ripple and xrp, but I’m hesitant to say RLUSD will boost the price instantly, or significantly solely off of usage. I could be, and hope I’m wrong. That would be a great suprise

What it will do however, is probably the most important thing for any long term play with a company like ripple, it adds credibility. Credibility is the #1 asset a company can have, especially one starting out like ripple. RLUSD adds to its product line, and will be the most compliant, transparent, and reliable stable coin on the market. Massive. It also opens the doors to institutions that are looking for an introductory solution in the space, without having to switch completely over to xrp before they know it’s the right move for them

If it can outperform circle, and eventually tether (which is known for not being very transparent and has issues with the government as of now) it secures ripple as the #1 crypto company on the globe for payment solutions, drastically improving the possibility for success of their IPO

Lastly, tether netted $6.2B in profit for 2023. That is huge. Imagine ripple netting half of that. 3/4. All of it. More. That would enable more acquisitions, more partnerships, more products, more marketing, more innovation, way more bottom line which equals more strength. Imagine this happening after IPO and when they have shareholder meetings they can announce these things. What about buybacks with revenue? Burns? It opens the door to what we want. Mass adoption. Best of luck, hope to see you on the moon ||| [removed] ||| I'm honestly not expecting anything serious.  
Not counting ""regular people"" buying it, like us, btw.

I always thought, and still do, that until utility and the usage itself is the main price-driving force, I shouldn't care as ""we're not there yet"".

We, the ""regular buyers"", should be the cherry on top, and I always felt that, at the end of the day, we will be a minuscule % of what affects the price.

But if this can affect the price with more impact than I thought, from utility itself...then I will just laugh cause that means, by ""my"" logic, that some of my ""impossible targets"" seem much easier to hit, lol.

EDIT: If I had to bet, I'd say the last paragraph won't happen, if that ""helps"" :D ||| As explained via meme below, institutions and bank :

![gif](giphy|sDcfxFDozb3bO) ||| Lower barrier to entry for liquidity providers because it becomes less risky for them and allows for easier on ramp/off ramp. Ideally this results in greater adoption. Also as others have mentioned this will result in more transactions in the XRPL which results in additional burn. The most important thing though is adoption. ||| Any transaction using RLUSD will use XRP on the back end. The more people using RLUSD to hold value, the more XRP will be used. 


I think........


Please correct me if I am wrong. ||| Think it this way.. It's a meme token that is pegged to the price of the USD. 

Liquidity of RLUSD is going to be XRP. ||| RLUSD is going to replicate the USD and XRP will be the vehicle used to transact RLUSD across borders ||| https://preview.redd.it/kkokodo2al6e1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44c0079c0bb7af553809bfd5f26787c7a89c06b6

This illustrates how xrp and the various RL stable coins with interact.  There will eventually be stable coins for most currencies.  The xrp acts as a bridge for exchanging. Quick and cheap.  the price of xrp may have to go up.  So a fraction of a coin will be needed to transact rather than a whole xrp.  I am a bit hazier on that detail but the diagram is correct. ||| Seems like XRP is treated like a stock rather than a coin now. ||| RLUSD is, in fact, a way for anyone but was designed for institutions to move their RWA (real world assets) into the digital world without risk of loss in a very general sense. Hince the name stable coin. 

With any market investment, including stable coins pegged to a certain value, like the federal reserve note. There is always the chance the RWA used to buy it could falter. Ie.. market crash, and so forth. 

Non the less, while the market holds  strength, it helps those with deep pockets off load thier reserve notes for something a bit more revolutionary. XRP is a deflationary asset, which means, over time.. at the rate at which xrp burns per transaction, it will take decades for it to show significant impact to the price. Rest assured though, 40, 50 years from now XRP will be #1 and nothing will topple it's riegn for a century i would wager. 

With lots a speculation of course. No one knows the future. I can tell you though it seems to me Ripple has thier act together. They continue to bring value and utility to the table. 

When, let's say half the world, move money for their purchases via the XRPL transactions, they will be in the millions a day. Hell, they might be that many already. RLUSD is meant to reduce the risk at entry and cover the value of the RWA. 

Not an advisor, and non of this is sourced information. Just my opinion on how this will work. If I had millions of dollars, I would certainly buy RLUSD for one simple fact. The US dollar $ since it was removed from the gold standard has steadily declined in value. I've been told the dollar only holds 3% value. That's right, 3%. 

Now imagine this scenario, I take my $5,000,000.00 and buy RLUSD with it. Then, sell the RLUSD to a different RWA. Let's say the Kuwaiti Dinar. Which has been notably the best performing RWA in recent history. $5 million @ 3% makes its true value 150,000. That's just stupid, but what happens when I switch RLUSD to the best value RWA, oil? Then, you've more than likely increased your value to face value or better.

With a set of eyes from an institution point of view, with some trials on beta severs or having AI run models on how to do this very thing. It could take a company on the brink of foreclosure to top 100, overnight? No?

Thanks, everyone, for reading. If you made it this far, I appreciate your time. I hope I've helped others understand how the new stable coin will work and bring value to the ledger, ultimately raising value on XRP itself. ||| OP this doesn’t answer your question, but adding it to the discussion so others can learn more about RLUSD and XRP’s relationship, and how David intends the system to work.

Transcript of David Schwartz's recent video explaining RLUSD.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9m--90PSg4

>Hi, this is David Schwartz, also known as JoelKatz, CTO at Ripple. I recently released a list of suggestions for XRP Ledger development, and I got a lot of questions about the stablecoin proposal. So I thought it might be helpful for me to walk through what I have in the design to give people a better idea of how I intended the system to work.

>Um, so first of all, it’s a collateralized stablecoin. That means tokenized assets whose value is are expected to remain constant in some unit. So if it’s a dollar stablecoin and you have 10 of it, you’re expecting its value to remain stable at $10. These assets have a backing asset, in this case, XRP. That means that there is something that is supposed to guarantee its value. Now, in some of those systems, you can actually redeem the stablecoin for the backing asset. In some, you can’t.

>What’s interesting about this proposal is that the stablecoins are perfectly liquid to XRP at face value on the ledger. So in other words, if you have a dollar and a dollar stablecoin designed on the system, what you have is a $1 claim on XRP, enforceable by The Ledger payment mechanics. And the reason that that’s important is with some other stablecoin designs, if the stablecoin isn’t popular, it won’t necessarily be liquid. If it’s not listed on an exchange, if it can’t easily be deposited and withdrawn, it won’t be that useful. By the design of this system, the stablecoins can be offered through the on-Ledger decentralized exchange, and they spend like XRP. So you don’t need to find some way to make them liquid. You can just spend them right on The Ledger. And of course, they can be pegged to anything that someone can provide a price feed on.

>Fiat currencies are probably what people typically think of, like dollars and Euros or whatever, but they can also be pegged to things like stocks or precious metals or any other value source as long as someone can provide a price feed for it. You can have a stablecoin pegged to that value.

>So there are five critical components to the system. There’s the operator, that’s the person or entity that provides the price feed and creates the system. There’s the price feed itself. There are the collateralized positions. These are the things that hold the collateral. Then there’s the Redemption process, which is the way that someone who holds the stablecoin converts it into XRP. And then there’s a series of incentives to ensure that the stablecoin remains convertible to sufficient XRP to back its value. ||| It'll boil down to percentages ||| As well as the connotation of RLUSD invoking the words “real usd”. Makes me wonder if they decided on the name knowing that one day it would be the U.S. dollar’s replacement. I know it stands for Ripple USD but RL seems like a shorthand spelling of the word real, unlike RP or any other combination of letters they could have used from “ripple”. That’s my theory and I’m sticking to it. ||| It will make it go up or down ||| It will most likely drop back disarm to the .43 cents area and hold for next 7 years. ||| Well, I believe that XRP and RLUSD are intrinsically connected. The XRP is the driver and the RLUSD is the stable coin blockchain. RLUSD is like no other stable coin, is far more superior and secure and will surely drive the price of XRP as RLUSD is utilized. ||| RLUSD will not help xrp. RLUSD will help Ripple only. ||| The amount of people in this thread thinking a single asset, owned (over 50%) by a private company will reach a fdv over more than the entire planets gdp is incredible. Makes me feel good hitting the button to close trade knowing in taking my profits from someone else's loss. ||| My $4K in XRP has grown. Only have $500 in RLUSD. ( Not financial advice) Does anyone think I should put more in RLUSD or transfer that $500 into XRP? ||| Well, let’s be real. The highest market cap of a company is $3 trillion. XRP is about $1.5B thus far but a 100x? 1000x? Nah. The product doesn’t warrant the company value, y’all pulling numbers from the sky like babies reaching for toys. Much of the crypto space is the same, tangible products zero, Swift have their own token which has been in the works for a good while I doubt they will give up much plus the contracts are probably pretty tight. ||| According to Binance, a small amount of XRPs supply is burnt every time RLUSD is bought/sold, gradually increasing XRPs price point without the purchase of XRP ||| If people just started using the on chain exchanges the burn rate would go higher. I can see people using RLUSD to store value more than anything but idk ||| It won’t,  

RLUSD Was created as a stable coin mostly for hedge funds and large investors to guarantee they don’t lose any money, ||| Think of RLUSD like Jeeps & XRP like ducks ||| I appreciate the time u took to reply ||| [removed] ||| Such an excellent explanation. 

Question: doesn’t the xrpl rail also allow stablecoins to run on it (usdt, usdc)? 

A while ago, I thought Ripple client banks asked to have the option to run xrpl transactions using usdt/usdc instead of XRP to reduce potential volatility in XRP pricing. So Ripple built the on-ramp.

Then Ripple saw they were contributing 20+% of transaction fees to usdt/usdc from transactions on their xrpl rail! Ripple wanted that fee revenue with their own stablecoin.  Then the legal battle. 

So the RLUSD approval is huge for Ripple. It will 100% grow Ripple revenue over time.  As for XRP price, I agree that’s unknown and uncertain for now…but I have my thoughts and views, which do align with yours.


My view:
The opportunities for further growth in Ripple clientele and partnerships across global banks, payment providers, mobile money operators is still huge. 

It would seem that the big end game is what technology proves it could end up being the best tech rail between US banks and the federal reserve. That tech could transform SWIFT and global reserve banking, where transaction size (and fees) explodes in size/volume/value.  Allowing global reserve institutions to hold XRP “in reserves” along with using RLUSD on the xrpl gets very exciting. 

FYI…I’ve been following Garlinghouse and Ripple since 2016.  My interest slowed as Ripple was mired in its long legal battle with Fed agencies. I view Ripple as an extremely important tech company (and technology) in assisting the preservation of the viability of USD’s global reserve currency status. 

It’s nice to see Ripple gathering momentum in attention again.  Even if it’s the “When Moon?” XRP speculators.  As people learn about XRP, it leads to learning about Ripple and ultimately about the workings of global digital banking, cross-border payments, the concept of a fiat currency as the value denominator of asset valuation, and the critical importance of having the USD as the global reserve currency. ||| Transaction fees are negligible and will not burn enough XRP to move the price.  Unless the transaction fee is increased by a factor of 100-10,000 you shouldn’t bet on the burn rate having any influence on the price of XRP. ||| Tether potentially being delisted across a bunch of European exchanges due to not meeting the MiCA regulations -  looks like RLUSD is fully MiCA compliant though... ||| My dude... 

1st: Let me say that you gave a very good explanation in your post. Love it when I can see and read where someone, with a good bit of knowledge and/or understanding of things, is willing to take the time, and to make the effort, in trying to explain things in an easy to understand layman's terms. That alone makes you one of the ""top good guys"", in my book anyway. 

2ndly: I'm sorry to see that you apparently think that you only have enough invested in XRP to get you to the moon. 
So, tell ya what I'm willing/going to do for ya (excuse me and some of my language as I'm a good 'Ol Southern boy)... Because you're so willing to give of your time/experience/etc in writing a reply/post like this and because I like to help a fellow XRP bro/sis out when/where I can, tell ya what I'm a gonna do. 

When XRP REALLY DOES finally go hyperbolic and those of us who've been smart/lucky enough to pack numerous and/or deep bags board our various rocketship's and become space bound.... I believe that I'll be some of those who'll either only see the moon in our rearview mirrors or who'll be stopping at the moon only long enough to refill our bags with more XRP/fuel for our ships engines, before continuing on to parts unknown WAY BEYOND the moon. 

So I'll make sure to stop at the moon and see if ya want to go a bit further than just the moon. And, if ya do, my family and I can make some room on my Lamborocket for you (and your family if ya got some) and can give y'all a lift. How's that sound? 🤔😁 

After all, the more the merrier, right? 🤔👍🤯👀😁🤣🤣🙀🙏🫶🤗🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌙.... And beyond. ||| [deleted] ||| ive just now began to accumulate XRP and the more i learn the more i realize i dont understand yet. great response man. thank ya ||| Great insight.
Thanks! ||| >anything on the xrpl runs on xrp, meaning every transaction will burn xrp in the background 

Can you explain that a little more in depth? Let’s say I’m converting USD to CAD and using the stable coin as an intermediary - is RLUSD being converted to XRP in the background? ||| I wish every response post in subredits were like yours.  It's basically perfect. ||| Great info, thank you kindly!🙏 ||| Ok, i respect that understanding. But that sounds more like superficial features than it does actual features hahaha. No disrespect tho lol. ||| So is this RLUSD release more “pump talk” than it is actual beneficial progress? ||| why does XRP, which has a max supply of 100 billion, possibly need a front end in RLUSD? ||| So 1 RLUSD will be made up of X amount of XRP depending on how many XRP coins = 1 usd? I have no idea if thats correct but that what im understanding from the explanation lool ||| How? I thought to be a certified stable coin it has to be back 1/1 with an actual USD ||| Interesting thought. ||| U think no price movement for 7 years? ||| I think you are missing the bigger picture ||| So u will get random XRP airdrops for holding RLUSD? ||| No problem 🤙 ||| Great inight ||| I have been following and holding XRP since 2018 and I did not know about said explanation thread... ty for this comment! ||| Much appreciated and no problem! ||| Thanks, I appreciate it! I believe you’re correct as I remember hearing that ripple was contributing to about 20% of usdc being minted through the use of stable coins for their operations. That’s an insane amount of money left on the table, as well as control in the stablecoin space

It sounds like you’ve done a lot of research and have been around for quite a while which is awesome. I agree with everything you’re saying, and the possibility of reserves of xrp being held is a massive catalyst not many people talk about. That would (and hopefully will) be huge, and essentially will propel xrp to being both a utility token as well as a store of value. I belive xrp will essentially break away from the current speculative market, and become a product that won’t be subject to bull/bear markets, have high volatility, or be thetherd to BTC. It essentially will be similar to electricity, in a sense that usage will ditermine it’s value

I feel like Ripple is on the path to being a global powerhouse, and one of the most important companies of our lifetime. Of course things can change, but if we keep going in the direction we’re hoping it will, I’ll be looking forward to seeing you on the moon brother ||| That’s correct, and I belive that ripple will continue to take the necessary steps to stay compliant and transparent. If tether becomes delisted, I believe RLUSD will eventually become the #1 stablecoin in the space, and ripple will have two tokens in the top 10 ||| Haha sounds good brotha, I’ll keep an eye out for you📈🚀 ||| Was just watching this video. Great stuff from David ||| Any transactions happening on the xrpl burns xrp since the burn is a safety feature created to validate a transaction. Since RLUSD is using the xrpl, the same burn as an xrp transaction will happen to validate it ||| No problem brother! 🚀 ||| Not only that, but RLUSD transactions will settle with XRP, from my understanding. So anytime RLUSD is used, XRP will be used. ||| XRP has a USD value to it. That is how they are going to fund the token.

Remember, this XRPL blockchain, the native token, is XRP, not USD. So the only way you are going to fund a token on XRPL is XRP.

To make this available on Solana, for example. They will trade xrp to Sol and then create the token rlusd there, which will be funded by SOL. ||| When you say “burn” do you mean it actually destroys XRP? ||| As you mentioned, IPO… I am so excited for this. I remember Brad saying that he was going to take the company public as soon as the lawsuit bs was over. Almost there! 🤘🤘🤘 ||| How does a stable coin use a volatile coin like XRP to settle transactions while not allowing the price of the RLUSD token to change? ||| Yes, a fraction of an xrp gets burned/destroyed with every transaction made on the xrpl. A lot of people don’t know about this feature, which is one of my favorite features of xrp. It’s deflationary, meaning xrp’s supply shrinks with every transaction ||| The stable coin pats the unstable coin on the head and says ‘everything is gonna be alright’. ||| Gas on the xrpl chain as one example. ||| But currently, the burn rate is FAR lower than the rate being released from Escrow. And there is SO much in escrow that the burn rate is really a long term helper but has no discernable effect on current prices. ||| Wouldn't that mean it is in best interest of ripple to keep the price of XRP low, so that they can have lower fees for those customers of RLUSD? ||| I guess then my follow up is - from where? Who owns the xrp that gets burned? ||| yep. that sums it up well ||| So u must hold some XRP to be able to transfer RLUSD in order to cover the gas fee of like  < 1¢ ||| From the transaction, it’s a fraction of an xrp. It’s a safety feature implemented into the xrpl to confirm or validate a transaction. I’d suggest researching “how the xrp burn works”, there’s quite a bit of info out there ||| Simple answer is no.

https://www.iso20022.org/faq

Ripple is a contributor to iso20022 which is neat though so assumption is they would be able to support the messaging standard along with more advance smart contracts like algorand (which can by structuring the note/message to the iso20022 standard)

“Cryptocurrencies are not inherently ISO 20022 compliant. There is a lot of confusion and misleading information on the web referring to ISO 20022 compliant cryptocurrencies but those statements are not correct. The cryptocurrencies are not managed and not registered by ISO 20022. ISO 20022 is a global standard for financial messaging and provides a common language and structure for exchanging financial information. The ISO standard managing Digital Token Identifiers (DTI) is ISO 24165.

While the financial institutions and payment systems have adopted or are in the process of adopting ISO 20022 standards for their operations, cryptocurrencies generally operate outside the traditional financial system and do not adhere to the ISO 20022 standard by default. Cryptocurrencies have their own protocols and messaging formats that are specific to each cryptocurrency’s blockchain network.”

“Yes. It’s worth noting that some cryptocurrency exchanges and payment processors may implement ISO 20022 compliance for their internal processes or interactions with traditional financial systems, such as banks and payment networks, to facilitate interoperability and compatibility with existing financial infrastructure.

These big tanks are manipulated by known (and most assuredly dastardly) and unknown forces and use special anti-XRP rounds developed by God only knows who. And they've been using these tanks and special type rounds to go after the entire XRP community but, we're a tough bunch and have been fighting back hard. The casualties have been high but, we've been discovering weaknesses in their armor and have been developing our OWN ""special anti- anti -XRP"" rounds to use against THEM and which were only recently distributed to the XRP Army. 

And these rounds have been EXTREMELY effective beyond even our wildest dreams. I mean, just look at what happened to the value of XRP in just the last (roughly) month. That'll tell you JUST how effective these new rounds have been that we've started using. 

However, this war isn't over yet. The enemy is still VERY strong and will definitely be bringing more weapons to bear in the hopes of destroying XRP, it's community members and supporters. 

But they'll have to get thru us.. the XRP Army, 1st. We've been here since at least 2014/2015, and we're not only STILL standing strong and proud but we're now even STRONGER and LARGER in numbers, as well. 

So never worry and never fear, the XRP Army is still here and we'll protect you. 

Note: The XRP Army is always looking for new, strong minded and diamond hands capable, recruits. If you think that YOU have what it takes to become a member of this PROUD (and elite) Army, then contact your local recruiter (these may be found on various Crypto platforms such as Coinbase or Uphold, just to name a few OR on/at various XRP/Crypto groups such as here) ||| They do this to blow up all the longs on leverage trading.

So, I'm guessing a lot will be known in the next year or two, regardless of the result and whether Ripple succeeds with all the plans they have or not.

Also, IMHO, this RLUSD thing is just one drop in the ocean, so no idea why people are hyped.  
Sure, it's a good thing but it's minuscule compared to the ""total package"" they are trying to achieve *\*shrug\** ||| 2025 will be the start of real world utility and when we see a corresponding price increase in XRP.

Japan will be the catalyst, once other world governments witness Japan going from a slow, outdated, technologically inferior state (with respect to finance), to a global world leader (at the flick of a switch), many many more will follow suit. They literally can't afford not to. 

From 2025 to 2030 we will start to see progressive adoption further increasing XRP demand and therefore price increases.

From there on the price will be dictated by Ripples success in establishing XRP as the status quo for international financial movement. When I look at the Ripple team, I personally see a team of people who can make this happen. 

If achieved XRP may well be looked at as the investment of a lifetime, if not lifetimes - think Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Amazon in the early days type of investment.

Just my humble opinion. DYOR. NFA. ||| I think even with use we don’t see true value of Xrp. We need to see Xrp backed by commodities like gold, silver oil and even new ways to back it like tokenized assets. Institutions are looking to tokenize housing, debt and a whole lot more. This will boost the value to unimaginable prices imo. We are just getting started and the more you know about what you hold the more it will take for you to let go of it. ||| This question should be asked this time next year.

Imagine how confident you'd have to be with a system to switch your financial system as a whole over.

Perhaps this gives more confidence to people who don't follow their work, and I get that, for sure.

I feel like infrastructure is already in place and it is just a flick of a switch. ||| Ok… well to answer your question will probably be the former vs the latter. Global regulations have to be put in place so the countries that do have crypto regulations are more likely to run away with the RLUSD stablecoin vs countries that don’t. Obviously growth is gradual in any scenario and so conservatively, don’t expect massive price spikes for the first 6 months. But at some  time in the future there is going to be an inflection point where it just shoots up. At the moment the industry is most likely going to be more mature and more stable. Hopefully this answers your question. ||| If a bank asked them to do this, or suggested it might be a good idea, Ripple can go away and do it quickly and effectively.

Just that it doesn't seem that big of a deal.

This would be most prudent of the exchanges. ||| I setup a RLUSD trust line on Xaman however it’s not ready to exchange with XRP yet. ||| my take is it would go live on the same date they were sued as a fuck you to the SEC ||| 💎🤲🏽 ||| Trump is opening the NY exchange this morning and Ripple loves Thursdays, maybe we need to watch this space. ||| They will most likely launch RLUSD as soon as it is ready which will have no bearing on the court case.   Once Trump is in office, he will have more authority to influence the case to be thrown out but it won't happen right away.  This is my very unprofessional guess. ||| How does the rlusd work with xrp and eth?
Are there pairings against both?

I had seen eth mentioned along with it and was confused as I thought it was an xrp sidechain ||| Believe it Shud be launch this few days ||| Will all the RLUSD launch at the same time at all exchanges or do they launch one at a time?

If all together means it may take a longer time to get ready…hopefully there is a countdown timer somewhere ||| Today at 14:00 est got a memo going out from Brad, will see then 😆 ||| Are we able to buy that stable coin from start or before? ||| Amazon and Apple have joined forces with XRP ||| Noob here. 

Will having money in xrp (ripple) give me auto access to the stablecoin or will a separate coin appear on my trading platform? ||| Lawsuit was to stop people buying.   
Price increase above $2+ was to stop people accumulating a big bag.    
60 minute interview was to stop people buying.

Microsoft - 1990s  
Amazon - 2000

From my understanding, Coin base is planning on delisting other unregulated stable coins around the same time. ||| Isn't it all under Ripple? ||| Can you share a little context on what is this? ||| Thanks for the heads up. I just set-up my trustline as well. ||| Whats the date of the sueing? ||| Pairings offered would be up to whatever exchange is going to support RLUSD. ||| That would differ from every trading platform, so it would all depend on what platform you're using. It would be up to every platform if they're going to support RLUSD. ||| You have it backwards. Stocks get suppressed due to uncertainty during a lawsuit and then ‘pop’ when that uncertainty is removed. ||| No, it was granted a couple of days ago. ||| Any idea what might be getting delisted? ||| XRP is not ripple. The case was about whether Ripple’s sale of XRP constitutes a securities violation. ||| In my Xaman wallet I setup a RLUSD trustline. It costs a little in XRP for the transaction to setup. Basically it adds the authentic RLUSD coin address to the wallet for trading. Currently there is a XRP/RLUSD swap feature available however it’s saying there are not enough offers to make this trade. Liquidity not available yet my guess. ||| Dec 22nd 2020 ||| But does it also use eth in some way?
Or just xrp? ||| Thanks for the update :). I just heard the news this morning otw to work exciting! I guess the EU will stop recognizing tether at the end of December too. Just in time ||| The king tether ||| Bitcoin ||| So it's AMM? ||| I’m assuming it’s just going to be a USD stablecoin that’s backed by XRP. ||| I thought that was just in the EU ||| Coinbase is de-listing Tether on Friday the 13th. ||| It appears it's already happened. ||| I just checked Coinbase and it is still open for purchase......as of now on the West Coast...perhaps East Coast is different lol. Jk. Still up though. ||| I just looked again it's only available through coinbase wallet ||| Interesting hmm...wonder what's up?

The numerous panic-posts over the past days across all manner of social media platforms, including reddit, is nothing short of pathetic. 

If you’re overtly concerned or stressed about a 20% dip after a meteoric 300% rise…I’m sorry to tell you, but you’re never going to make it. 

Time IN the game will win, every time. 

Relax and hold…HOLD your XRP.","1. Researched before investing
2. Invested what I can consider lost from that moment on

8 years hold in a couple of months.  
No panic, no stress, no emotions, at any point in time (reason is above, #2).  
Nothing changed, ""the plans"" are still possible, and nothing tells me it's going for the worse since then.  
In fact, if anything, only good (and ""neutral"") news so far.

If I can do 8, I can do 10, 15, whatever.

If it succeeds, great, I might enjoy life a bit more.

If not...well, nothing changed, so all good :D ||| Whoever reads this post have no impact on xrp price. People panic cuz it’s people. ||| It's easy to see most of these posters over the past few days are not XRP veterans. We've been through the ringer, this is literally nothing new to us. I'm glad more people are learning about Ripple, but some of these people need to take a breather. ||| I think my first buy was in 2017. It was in the 20 cent range. ||| Unless you hold a terrible asset. Then time in the game is bad ||| Nah, buy when it dips. And then hold. Retardation is holding without actually watching the market.

RASPEK! ||| My first was .31…   
It immediately dropped to .13, so I bought more. ||| I wish you understood why it hit 3 and then dropped, because you clearly don't ||| XRP price in 2016 was sub ten cents as a high… So fix your date or gtfo mate. ||| The point I was trying to make is that it's really not hard to just hold.

Just don't invest the amount you can't forget about, and that's pretty much it.  
You set your goals just before you buy, and then you wait for those goals.

If you hit it, you execute the plan.

If not...like I said, nothing changed, you're still living as you are now.

So, yeah, it really can be that easy, and everything depends on you (not you you, I mean anyone in general :D)",96,21
Reddit,XRP,1hbbc62,2024-12-10 20:26:09,"XRP Quiz For what it's worth, here are my questions and thought regarding the current price action of XRP.
Question 1: do we really believe that the institutional money/Wales is getting into this space?
Question 2: has the token price gone parabolic recently?
Question 3: is it true that whales and institutional traders are able to manipulate prices in the short run by placing huge trades one way or the other?
Question 4: are those same whales and institutional traders likely shaking out the weak hands vis-à-vis this recent selling?
Question 5: do we still believe in the long-term bull case for XRP?

Reddit,XRP,1hb4abq,2024-12-10 15:28:00,Toastwallet - need help  Restored an old toast wallet and balance was accurate. 10 seconds later most of it was gone. I made sure I used the back up site on the Toastwallet twitter account. Can anyone help?,"Hope this is not the case OP. but seen this a few times recently. 

It generally goes - put seed into a none legitimate website and lost funds. Not 100% sure but I think the toast wallet is discontinued

https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/s/xbNbjnWtiS ||| There are many fake websites that only drain your XRP balance; you should've been more careful.

You can download the Toast installation files (for Mac and PC) from the original author's GitHub repository here:
https://github.com/ToastWallet/core/releases/tag/3.0.0

I wouldn't trust other sites. ||| Totally unrelated but has one recovered a toast wallet from an old computer that was backed up with a Apple ""time machine"" backup

Do you think the time machine would have stored the recovery json file? ||| I think I already know I’m screwed, but if I never got a backup/can’t find it, but I have my six word recovery phrase is there any way I can recover my XRP? ||| Can you post which website you went to? ||| I still use toast wallet and funds have been there since day 1 and just bought xrp recent and transferred them there so far so good ||| Same thing happened to me. Used the correct website and all and still stolen. 700 xrp bye bye. ||| Most likely this. Toast wallet hasn’t existed for years now. ||| looks like i got got. thanks for the insight ||| I downloaded the app and it has no option to open up a wallet on your disk. Only a restore of a backup. ||| toastwallet.io ||| Toast Wallet generates a JSON backup file the first time you create a wallet, allowing you to restore it later on. However, I’m not sure if you have that file.
You could also use Xaman Wallet, which is a trustworthy wallet (previously known as Xumm). You just need your private key or mnemonic (a set of 12, 16, or 24 words) ||| Sorry man, that might be the wrong one. I used https://toastwallet.github.io/browser/ ||| I have two files from two different wallets. One is an rtf backup file. I was able to feed that into the app and put in the pin and see the contents of the file but I can't transfer any of the money out because the phrase I wrote down ages ago only has 14 words in it. I tried putting in the first 12 but that didn't work.  This wallet only has 25 xrp in it so I guess although it's not nothing it's not life changing in any way.

The second thing I have is a pair of files default_wallet and default_wallet_pkey.  I have no idea what to do with those because the app I downloaded doesn't have the option of opening up any files just uploading the backup.  I have no idea what to do with these. I don't even know how much xrp they have but I suspect it may be more.

Any help would be appreciated. ||| yes this is what i used ||| Do either of those default _wallet files contain a 29-character alphanumeric string starting with the letter “s”?

If so, that's your XRPL Account private key. You can use that to import your account into something like the XAMAN self custodial software wallet 'app'. ||| They look the same but io could be a phishing site ||| It seems to be a file full of  random characters ||| 29 of them? ||| No, I am looking at the file and it's just random characters. Why do you think the phrase I recorded had 14 words? That's what's puzzling to me.",11,22

Powerful show. 👀

The most positive takeaways for a 60 minutes viewer may have been:

Ripple employs 900 people

The CEO went to Harvard Business School

Ripple donates to Fairshake and that PAC is left/right neutral and helped both Democrats and Republicans get elected

The pro crypto guy was calm

The anti crypto guy was nervously laughing

…Do you not have access to YouTube???..

If you watched the interview then you wouldn’t be posting this nonsense. They aired a hit piece trying to make it seem as if Ripple ‘payed’ their way into politics by endorsing politicians. 

Anyone who has been holding XRP for a while after doing their own research isn’t worried about a 10cent dip. It just did a 400x in less than a month and your worried about a 10cent drop? 🤣 people who FOMO in after watching influencers making ridiculous claims CONTINUE to make posts about “ohhhhh nooooo XRP just dipped!!” After it does what any crypto does after run, it retraces…. Nothing goes up forever in a straight line 🤦‍♂️ ||| The core demographic that watches that show probably doesn't have an account where they could buy XRP.  But, now they've heard about Ripple and XRP, and probably want to know more.

Watch for a spike in search trends.  Give it time. ||| All these things are pre-run buy the roomers sell the news ||| Why the interview didn’t do too hot? Because 60 Minutes had a direction they wanted to take it and went that direction. It’s has nothing to do with Ripple

There is something about the dip though, at the time of writing this the top 10 are down

If xrp fell in price and the rest of the top 10 followed, then xrp is moving the market off of news

If that isn’t the case, it didn’t drop because of the interview. It was simply following the top 10 dipping, which then has nothing to do with xrp ||| 60 minutes used Brad to bash crypto super pacts: however, they failed to mention the big pharma, big oil or telecom contributors to public officials. Not to mention sec former sec lawer lying on camera to the boomers. Now I’m going to have to reprogram my mom and aunts 🤦🏽‍♂️ ||| But wasnt brad garlinghouse supposed to be on the show ?!! ||| It was all manipulation, as expected, always sell the news. ||| it crashed because whales were selling, not because it’s a bad asset. ||| We need to get Brad on the Joe rogan experience. ||| the interview is on youtube.  check it out when you have a min ||| Well many people simply don't understand that mainstream media is financially backed by powerful people who don't want the public to support crypto right now until it's fully controlled by them. And they would never allow the SEC to be portrayed negatively. 

And think about who the viewers of 60 Minutes are. Do we really think people interested in crypto even watch mainstream TV shows? I don't know why anyone thought this would do anything. It didn't hurt or help. ||| Buy the rumor sell the news is the saying. Would not expect good press for XRP. That's just been the case for several years. ||| Can we please get Joe Rogan to interview Brad Garlinghouse? We need a real non-bias interview. Please let’s get his attention! ||| The editing staff and reporter tried turning it into a hit piece the way they structured the interview and basically accused ripple of wrong doing.

Maybe that’s why it went down some? That’s just my two cents. Was kind of a BS deal from 60mins. ||| Literally every crypto in the top 100 fell because bitcoin fell.

Sounds a lot like

Considering everyone on Reddit was praising Kamala to the high heavens, I expected red being the last color I would see.

🖖 ||| Reset your expectations. Learn from it ||| Not everyone in the XRP was praising it, it was mostly the influx of new investors to crypto that jumped on the bandwagon and are bringing over their cringe GME movement to the sub. ||| Correlation does not imply causation, would be cool if it did though because once I stubbed my toe and belched together. ||| That's just new these days.

Bitcoin is hardly dipping today and most other cryptos are down 20%. If bitcoin goes down to something like 75K, XRP will go down close to a $1.50. It’s just how it works. ||| ""I know him...

Reddit,XRP,1h9el8e,2024-12-08 08:40:10,"Might be too late to buy XRP I'm just curious and have FOMO because this might increase after all this hype and enthusiasm, especially with the events going on. I usually get paid twice a month and am just waiting for the last paycheck of the month, which is a week and a half. What are the forecasts and predictions looking like before the end of the month, then January to February?
My goal is to own 10k of XRP, which might be impossible since it's probably going to be high when those days come, especially during this upcoming altcoin season.","It’s never too late. Coinbase always takes my money no matter what time or date it is 🤙🏻 ||| Dude. No one can tell the future. XRP may do well it may not. Its a gamble. Be cautious with your money and only Invest if it you are prepared to lose it. ||| if you invest in xrp with a long-term outlook be prepared for a wild ride it's likely going to have big dips and big bounces ||| Dude, Bitcoin hit 300 dollars and it was all over the news and people stated it was too late to buy in. How much is BTC today? 

Get the hint or we need crayons in this sumbitch? ||| Just get to 1k XRP ||| Xrp hits 10 $  gonna make a lot of millionaires ||| Buy high sell low 👍 ||| I don't think your late, I think your right on time. Just invest what you can afford, and don't throw your life savings at this. Stick to the basics. The less you invest, the longer you will have to hold. There will be ups and downs, but you shouldn't care. You're gonna have to take your emotions out of this. But go for it. There will be people that's going to try to tell you what the price is going to be... don't listen, it's all a lie until you pull your money. ||| I always think it’s too late to buy crypto/stocks and it just keep going up ||| I bet you have a shot at sub dollar again. Been here a minute. 

Don’t fret on what you didn’t buy. There something else undervalued out there currently find it. 

Better to ask yourself why you didn’t buy a few months ago and ask yourself why you want to buy now. That will help you moving forward more than a 2-5x in xrp. 

If it even makes it to the upper fibs… you better have those sell orders set and not bitch about the slippage.

Edit: this is ATL season. ||| Always buy for long hodl ||| Fear...makes you make the wrong decision ||| Go buy. You're not too late. Next year won't be too late either. You'll just wish you would have bought today. ||| Best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. 2nd best time is today.

Manage your expectations and be patient. Only put in what you could afford to live without.

Make wise decisions and know that not every tree you plant will grow big and strong. ||| Why don’t you research Ripple find out what they do when they started and that sort of thing. You can make a decision on that sort of information instead of gambling ||| How is it to late..? Did they run out? ||| Could do literally anything over the next 10-15 years. It would be a shame if one looked back thinking if only I would have got in at $10 bucks. No one knows what’s going to happen, just like people were shocked when Bitcoin saw $100. It was unthinkable. ||| We’re at just over half ATH. Not too late HOWEVER after holding for like 5+ years my cynical ass still thinks it will go back to .48 and this whole Sub will meme the .48 cents guy. ||| JUST BUY 1… if we went back in time and I told you at $2.50 you would turn that to 100k in a few years would you turn it down? If not JUST GO BUY 1. And hold it forever. ||| Brother, this shit is only going up. ||| 1 month later and it shots up to 3.30 hope you been buying and stacking ||| Seeing this a month later, I really hope you bought. ||| DCA if you believe in it ||| really getting sick of posts like this ||| 50/50 take ya chances. ||| Nobody know what crypto will do. Period. It’s all speculative. More people on board equals more money, but I’ve been thru two full cycles now and all I can say is don’t listen to anyone and do what you feel you want to do. Just make sure you can afford whatever that decision may be. ||| It’s not too late it’s still early ||| I have 3,000 XTP since it was 0.17
I wish I had bought more, but I couldn't afford more back then ||| I think we hit $3 tonight bc of 60mins and $5 next month ||| Youre trying to buy the top ||| Expect a dip after 60 min. Be ready to buy. ||| I highly disagree with you, i dont think its too late to buy in at all.  I truly believe we're watching the beginning of a blow up.  XRP is at this point, the only clear crypto in the market.  He went against goliath (SEC) and won.  what a time to be alive. ||| This isn't like Bitcoin, Solana or Ethereum. XRP isn't designed to 50x. It stays low. ||| Remind me! 8 hours ||| Is it under the ATH? 

Then it’s not too late. ||| If you want 10k of xrp just start buying it at a steady rate.the price will fluctuate and you might end up paying more or less  than 10 k for it but it is still an investment and carries the risk of loss ||| Honestly, I'd consider putting in some money and then putting a ridiculously high sell order at like 5 bucks and forgetting about it. ||| Non sense. Keep buying ||| Expect it to bottom 1.82 and hit a spike ||| Hurry up and buy ||| Now is an excellent time to buy whatever you can while the price is down.  You don't have to buy all at once.  Just buy the dips.  But be aware that the new bottom levels that are set will likely continue to rise. In any case, it's better to have some now, than have none.  Then hold firm; there will be market swings, but progress will be upward over time.  Patience is key.  Cryptocurrency is in its infancy still, but will have a large utilitarian purpose in time.  It continues to progress. ||| Not late at all, keep accumulating. ||| I've been in it since 50 cents, maybe a little less. I dont buy and sell, I hold and add when opportunities present itself...

My investing choice, not financial advice. ||| My son and I just  to buy $200 worth and see what happens. Have no clue what wallet or storage to go with any one have a good idea. Thank you ||| Just keep on DCA in i started with 45 XRP now. I'm at 16k in just over a year and a half. ||| If there were 4 stages of Crypto evolution, 4th stage being crypto is normalized in everyday processes that people don’t even think about it anymore, I’d say we’re in late stage 1 or early stage 2. ||| Last time I feared it might be too late and bought it (at 1,5) it sank some days later to 0,5. Luckly I didn't buy much. ||| My take on XPR is that biggest ride is behind. If you look at price targets from 6-12months ago  then we are way above the most. But the scene is crypto-optimistic now and the ride might continue many months ahead. Hype and hyperoptimism is also a catalyst but also a damaging force that causes extra fluctuations and stress to ""paper"" holders. But in the end i´m sleeping my nights well with XPR bacause i trust the process. Ripple is doing work that seem trustworthy. ||| Nope it going to be $6-$7 by 2027, if you buy Xrp now it’s like you are buying bitcoin in 2017,2020,or 2022.
Xrp & lite coin has not catch up to its real value what it supposed to be on 2024. ||| If u just bought the top, don't expect life changing wealth until 2029 and (unless your 5x away from life changing wealth) ONLY IF u DCA all the way down and up until we hit 2029. Sorry to be there bearer of bad news but it is what it is.

I round tripped my bags from 2020 felt stupid, but i got in the lab, and bought all of 2022 and 2023 EVERY WEEK. That's the only reason I'm in a position to make $5 million this cycle. If ur just now getting here, ur late. Sorry, but not all hope is lost. Do your self a favor, study and buy $100 every week from now until 2029 and you will be rich, I guarantee it.

If u don't believe me that's OK, u will surely find out.
Good luck out there ✌️ ||| Didn’t even read. 

FUD. ||| Buy on the dips. ||| Probably need 100k min ||| I feel like xrp will next year will force people to sell when it hits 10$ plus . And then boom , it will be too late to buy in when all banks start using xrp, we could see astronomical numbers on xrp . I will always hold 500 xrp Incase it hits 1000$+ ||| Millionaires by ""unrealized gains"" you mean. :) ||| Do you write aphorisms for a living or is it just your side hustle? 🤣 ||| Agreed, the supply is huge and burning rate is slow. Ripple owns the majority of XRP. There is only one of their project using it to my understanding. To reach 10$, the market cap would need to be larger than BTC which is I don’t personally believe… I might be wrong though. ||| TOOK A LEAP OF FAITH AND IM GRATEFUL! 💸 ||| YES, YES I DID! I BOUGHT IT AT 2$ AND TOOL A LEAP OF FAITH. ||| We need them for liquidity ||| the win isn't in ||| I expect it to be $5/6.00 around the 20th of January 2025. Before July 2025 I hope it will be around $10.00 by then we’ll have a new pro crypto chair.

BTW, after 60 minutes or during the broadcast I expect a lot of volatility. ||| I don't think so.  Based on prior chats of when to buy and sell the target right now, it is 2026 to sell,  which at that point is the top.  This is, of course, based on charts and data that form a pattern of high and low points of the market.  The question isn't the price but regulation.  Will the United States be fully regulated by then? Will countries be ready to transition to crypto fully? We know it has to be a problem that follows a reaction with them providing a solution. What will the problem be ""Black Swan"" war, cyber attack,  another ftx fiasco, dollar collapse, hyperinflation, global internet outage,  blackout,  civil war,  etc.? We don't know right now we have many events going on, so it's hard to determine what they may want to do; unless you research their actions to determine what would be the probable cause.  The reaction is self explanatory,  The solution will see as right now we have strong indicators that suggest it's xrp/RLUSD. A lot can happen, and another shakeout could occur. In short, we don't know the price or when it will hit certain targets.  Just have an exit strategy if you're unsure and diversify. ||| You jest. Fomo on the tops and panic sell on the bottoms like a pro ||| You mean buy on top and sell on dips.

|-|-|-|-| ||| Trump ruined crypto by introducing his own coin. Crypto can become a joke if some one like him can “joke” around with all crypto holders..

He can now become a multi billionaire but in my opinion can destroy crypto by making it a “fool”. ||| This is the way ||| Ripple relases 1 billion of XRP at the first of each month. Ripple buy majority of the 1 Billion usually 80 percent “800,000,000” tokens and puts them in escrow which they don’t have access to. Learn how the XRPL works. ||| All good tho. I've bought all October just wished I bought all last year now lol ||| Do your research, the case definitely went their way.  Also, they won that case a while back, the latest court filings was about a settlement but XRP was ruled not a security a while ago.  They won! ||| Yeah for sure bro that's why xrp isn't $6 ||| Ripple holds 55B (55% of total supply) in the Escrow to help stabilize the price. The 1B release per mth and their buy back has nothing to do with this.  Also, the entire 55B escrow is set to be released in 2027. I thought it was earlier but just looked it up to confirm. So its exactly what I said. A race to adoption before dilution. How much adoption you think is gonna happen in the next 2ys with big corporations like banks. Hint: I work at a top 5 US Bank.

XRP at a higher value makes sense, as lower prices require more XRP to move money, thus exposing both parties to arbitrage.

Reddit,XRP,1h8gnv1,2024-12-07 00:56:07,"XRP price needs to be high instantly before regulations? So want to get thoughts from people, the price needs to shoot up high, thinking that $1000-$10,000 range before regulations come in. A high price to allow to cover all the money that will flow in from banks nostro/vostro accounts/any other assets that need to be covered. And slowly the value of XRP will be backed by assets to ensure it doesn’t crash. If it’s done after regulations, it will run into the risk of everyone pulling their money out from other markets to put into XRP knowing it will rise as the regulations state that it will be used by banks etc.

XRP VALUE DOES NOT MATTER.
It is used to make quick transactions.
Banks will buy and sell instantly, and anyone who holds can make some profit but don’t expect big bucks, EVER. ||| flawed logic at best.

AM INEVITABLE. *LIFTS INFINITY GAUNTLET OF PARTNERED NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL BANKS* *SNAPS BTC AWAY* ||| Yes, in the next few weeks everyone swaps bitcoin for xrp. Source: I just wrote it down so i’ve read that somewhere. ||| What did I just read? ||| Systematic market adoption? ||| Either that or the price is actually higher on the private ledger and once they have all the ducks in a row the public exchanges will reflect what’s on the private, which would result in similar high price instantly ||| That's what they have been doing the last four years. Just BIDEN time. I'm another guy with a tin foil hat though, so don't mind me. ||| Just a thought: i get where you try to go with this. But xrp delivers fast much faster then SWIFT. But what if xrp just takes 15min to transfer the complete a really high amount instead of 3-5sec they advertise. Lets say 10mil each transaction in 5sec. If you want to transfer 1b would take 100transactions of 5sec is 8,5min. Thats still a lot faster and cheaper then swift does. ||| Iso20022 is just a messaging standard being adopted by banks. It really doesn’t have anything to do with crypto. ||| Market cap is such a poor metric, if I have 100 umbrellas, and I sell 1 for $1, you are saying my market cap is $100, but then if I sell one for $1m, I now have a market cap of $100m? ||| Alright, explain this to me: How does XRP’s value tie into Ripple’s success? If XRP becomes the bridge currency—the ‘VISA or Mastercard’ of crypto—does Ripple itself come out as the big winner because they control the infrastructure? Does XRP’s price even matter, or is it just a tool for faster payments? Or do banks skip all this and just go straight to using blockchain tech without needing XRP at all? ||| There would have to be some high price that it reaches, whether that’s $1 /$10 /$1000, if banks want to send high value transactions one right after another within the span of 3secs, it will spike the price for the next bank to purchase XRP but then can crash the price when the next bank goes to sell ||| Legal jargon, backdoors. ||| The conclusion. ||| It’s way higher on private. 
XRP/Ripple is waiting for the final verdict, regulation, and 2025 tbh.. the shit we seeing right now is nothing. They can’t release most of the NDA’s and partnerships until the US comes in line. 

But I wouldn’t keep my full eye on just XRP. A lot of folks are neglecting the other projects running on the XRPL that will be more explosive then XRP. Your thoughts? ||| The standardisation of messaging helps facilitate broader integration between blockchains and current banks ||| The total amount of assets worldwide is worth 450 trillion. So you’re telling me that you truly believe that if xrp is worth $5,000 a coin it will be worth than more than all assets collectively on earth? Delusion. ||| The XRPL and XRP aren’t controlled by Ripple, anyone can build onto the XRPL. A high price of XRP allows for transactions not requiring large quantities of XRP to move large volumes of value. ||| Not if RLUSD comes into play. ||| What other projects on the XRPL are you looking at? ||| You don’t have to put in $450T to get a market cap of $450T is what I’m saying, if I have a company, and it has 500T shares, I sell one share to someone for $1 , and I own the other ~$499.999T shares, does that mean my company is now worth $500T? ||| Fiat transactions might be able to use the liquidity from the stable coins, but when the value of a house needs to be transacted and other non liquid assets that’s where XRP could also be used ||| Solo, Coreum, XRPH ||| These are all assumptions at this point. I’ve read scenario’s where XRP would just be used as some sort of transaction fee, while RLUSD will hold the actual value of the transaction.
Who knows how it will turn out… ||| Sounds like you’ve done your research brotha. Very nice. How do you feel about Axelar and the future of cross chain interoperability? ||| This. It makes no sense to have trillions of dollars move through a fluctuating value. XRP is a bridge, not a highway. It must simply be a fee transaction method approaching, with likely some other coins from the XRPL in place for other systems around the world. There's still plenty of potential for positive change in XRP value, but it will not be dependent on adoption, but on USE, which will take time. There is no get rich scheme, there never will be again, that bandwagon is gone. There ARE ways to make a solid profit. I suggest anyone in XRP who finds a range that puts them ahead, it's good to take your winnings, otherwise you may be giving up what for some have said is all you have worked for. Don't buy into the hype so much you lose it all, not all eggs in one basket. XRP is looking like your usual 70% peaks after ATH all that time ago. Looks like every other coin on the market, big hype price, smaller hype price, smaller hype price, then dead. XRP is showing it's second, SMALLER, hype price. See it for what it is. Trust me I want it to go well, after profits I put back in at 2.53. I want it to go well, but I see what's happening for real. ||| I love the tech and its EVM.

Reddit,XRP,1h8bs4e,2024-12-06 21:07:44,"Xrp not dropping in price when the bull market is over...? Like the other coins will..

I've heard quite a few people say this and I find it hard to believe.

At the moment, my mindset is sell xrp as close to the top as possible during the bull run and buy back in as close to the bottom of the bear market, to me this seems to most intelligent option.

I have a slight nagging doubt, maybe I've watched too much xrp vale, but could xrp really just keep going and going and never crash.

I have a fear of selling xrp around $15 and xrp hitting $10,000 a coin a year later.

Just wondering, any thoughts on this scenario.","Ideally everyone wants to sell as close to the top as possible, but the question is; when is the top? It's next to impossible to tell in the moment. Only in hindsight.

However, I must say, to think the price won't drop while everything else does is just as bad as saying you'll think we'll moon or think we'll drop < $1. To speak anything with such conviction in this space shows how ignorant one is.

From what I've gathered, it seems the best approach is a completely unemotional and systematic one. Put in place an algorithm or set of conditions that will enable you to sell or buy. You will likely never hit a top or bottom, but you will be realizing value. This is 99% ahead of everyone in the space, even myself. I struggle with selling due to tax implications, and yes, the very fact that I am greedy. This is despite no matter how much research I do. But I feel I am getting there. ||| A lot of us feel the same way. Sell some hold the rest? Sell all buy back in? The dilemma as you say is what if it doesn’t crash or drop much. Make a plan and make secondary plans if things change. I have been accumulating 4 years now. Sell some early for bills, a loan and college funds. Sell a bit higher to pad my fidelity account and change my life a decent amount. After that keep selling step by step as it goes up. I’m looking at ranges of $5-$13 to stay realistic (hopefully being realistic). I want to take enough out early to be satisfied with the effort I have put in to get here since we have no idea if $5 will be the max or $8 or what. I don’t want to bag hold 4 more years completely. I plan to hold onto some forever no matter what - at least what I have still in short term capital gains. BUT, if the price does go to the stars like $15-27 then I will probably go all out and see if I can or want to buy back in or just be happy with my life change. Of note, I am 52 years old. It’s kind of getting towards now or never to slow down working my ass off and overtime (to buy XRP). I don’t have a lot of cycles left in me. So anyway make a plan but have multiple other plans depending on what happens. Keep in mind no matter what you do, you won’t do it right or anywhere close to perfect. The goal is not perfect, the goal is come out alive. No matter how you do it you will have regrets so just accept this fact.

Edit: I don’t know how old you are but I saw a video that hit home with me. The primary goal is to move your life up one significant level. Make sure you do that. If you go for the stars only you likely end up where you started. ||| The best thing you can do for your sanity is to stop watching any and all XRP influencers. Assuming you value your sanity.

You can play the scalp game, I’d argue it’s prudent but this is the closest I’ve ever seen crypto get to mainstream acceptance. Not just consumer wise but compliance/legal/regulatory wise as well. I’d scalp but keep a sizable bag static incase you’re wrong.

Once again, I am begging you to ignore any and all XRP influencers. ||| Set yourself a goal and run with it. 


I have a price point I'll sell 600 coins that'll return me circa 100% of my investment. At that point, I'm just going to take the YOLO approach and see where it goes. ||| If you can let us now when the top and bottom is that would be appreciated. ||| Spoiler, it will drop when the bull market is over just like every other coin. If it takes good steps this run it just won’t go as low as usual. Know what you hold, but also don’t miss out on the bull run because social media people are saying they won’t ever sell under 1000 ||| It will drop, but it will go up again, just like any other valid coins ||| What kind of trader are you?

Long hold?
Day?
Swing?
Seasonal?
Casual?

Your question isn't a one size fits all answer and is dependent on goal setting, risk taking and your expectations. 

Based on the question, I'd say just buy and hold forever, putting in a few bucks a week, or a payday and don't even look at the numbers except to decide whether to diversify as the market grows. ||| To be honest, this is nothing. Wait till feb the price is going to be up. ||| If you have my luck, if you try to sell at the ""top"", it can keep rising and leave you behind. 

If you do this, consider only trying it with a portion of your holdings, like no more than 15%-20%-ish. Some people get lucky timing the market. Personally, I don't like to put myself in a position that relies on ""luck"".  

Warren Buffett has a saying about the stock market that I think applies to crypto too:  
""...The stock market is a device that transfers wealth from the impatient to the patient..."" ||| If you knew exactly what XRP is you wouldn’t even think about selling. Also XRP ain’t going under $1 again, at least after when the bullrun is over ||| Couple things.  It will drop in price like every other crypto. If you can sell at 15$ then count yourself lucky on all the FREE money you just made. ||| [removed] ||| Every market recedes no matter the asset ||| I think a lot of people plan to buy back in even if they do sell - markets go up and down but its hard to know when you are going past a price you wont go back to… I plan to keep some XRP long term regardless, but will invest some $ in my business ||| I hear you… We are a strange lot. I’m sure the price will go up… And I’m sure it will come down. As far as how low it will come down? Nobody knows. When it hits between four and five dollars, I will shave some off and anticipation of a retrace and buy more when the price hits three dollars. When the price $20, I will take close to half, and leave the rest ride. I think it’s in for the long haul, couldn’t hit $10,000? Nobody knows. But it’s fun to think about. My father spent 10 years teaching me stocks… And the one thing he drilled into me… If you’re buying at the top, and selling at the bottom… You’re taking too much risk. that’s where so many people got into trouble with the all-time high and the spike at 2020. Greed will get you every time. You have to pick a number, pick a plan, and stick to it. Leaving some in the bank… Never a bad idea especially if you’ve made your money and then some. I got my XRP at $.15… And my bag is sitting inside a Roth IRA vault… So I’m good. ||| XRP bull run was stopped by SEC last cycle. Price what you are seeing should have come last cycle. Now it’s cycling 2 times. No one knows the top or bottom. ||| I'm selling half at 5, a quarter at 10 and keeping the rest for the long haul. Different goals for each amount. That way I'm not getting screwed by selling or not selling. ||| It's going to drop and people are going to get scared and sell. That happens, xrp IS NOT A GET RICH QUICK. Just enjoy the ride and come back in 5 to 10 years and love the millions you didn't sell when it dropped. ||| 10,000 a coin?! 

What are you smoking 
I need some of that ||| You can only go off of what we know is true to happen. Bitcoin sets the price action of the entire market. ||| The bull markets not over? Is it? ||| Remember the influencers that are talking about XRP now are the same ones 6 months to a year ago that were trash talking it.

Is there any other reason not to listen to them? ||| What do you mean by scalp? ||| This run actually triggered a couple of my take profit orders already.

I bought at about 0.25c

I've only got one open order left, and then it's hold the last bag. If it drops back without a good reason I'll buy back from the profits and increase that bag total a bit.

I'm up about 2000% in three years... ||| thats what i did back in the day, atm all my crypto is pure profit basically. already got my investment out (plus a bit more i have to say) and kinda letting it run unless i see a number that might make me get out. ||| I'm the same, I have a set number that will allow me to keep 1k xrp and put it into a hard wallet and forget whilst getting my original investment back. ||| Here, for this ONE and ONLY, ONE, time I will answer this for you. 

But, 1st know that I usually charge a pretty significant fee for this type of info. After all, coming by this type of info isn't cheap, easy nor free.

So, without much further Adieu, here goes. 

After consulting with AI, speaking with my Tarot card reader, talking with some big names in investing (and especially those in Crypto), as well as a couple of my attorneys who know a thing or two about crypto, my own, personal, financial advisor and combining all of this with my own, now approx 10 yrs or so, of crypto/crypto investing experience, I've now got an answer for you. 

The ""Top""= When the price no longer continues in an upward momentum 

The ""Bottom""= When the price no longer continues in a downward momentum. 

No, no, no, do not thank me. It was MY distinct pleasure to be able to help y'all in this serious financial matter and question. And I hope it now helps anyone who needed this advice to become richer than they ever dared to dream. 

Now, if y'all don't mind, I'm EXTREMELY tired and worn out from all this researching for you, and I'm now off to bed to rest and recuperate. 😁👍🙀❤️🤗 ||| Me too please.  It important that I iron out the last, few bugs on my “Buy high, sell low” strategy. ||| Thanks Tom ||| Long hold I guess, I've been buying xrp since the top of the last bull run.


Not the best time to start buying but it was a small amount and I've dca'd in for the last 3/4 years, so I'm doing well.


I always assumed I'd sell in this bull run ||| Maybe March or April lol.    February kind of sucked ||| Fair point, but what's your plans long term?


You've got to sell at some point surely? ||| Why will every coin drop? ||| How can you have crypto on a ROTH IRA? ||| Inoguration day hasn't even happened. We just started folks.

There is big money to be had here. ||| Own what? ||| I forgot I owned it until I logged into my wallet last week and found out it'd been cleared out by hackers in late 2021 :/ ||| ☝️ ||| Gotta confess... got some BTC traded to XRP ($1.47)... when reached $2.56... kept a little XRP and traded back to BTC, earning some more sats. Now... kinda in the FOMO to trade back to XRP... but... BTC is not high enough and XRP is not low enough... tomorrow is 8... and .... got this FOMO on my shoulders! ||| Yes, that’s the main reason.

They get paid for views. Whether their information is true or false isn’t up to the normal scrutiny of journalistic integrity as it’s likely 90%+ of your fan base is inherently in agreement with whatever they say. Essentially, they are preaching to the choir. This is exasperated by the fact that XRP influencers tend to only focus on XRP and other ISO20022 coins and associate with similar influencers. 

Suffice to say, they all smell their own farts. Once you understand the general aim of Ripple and XRP, just buy. You don’t need daily indoctrination. You’ll miss other opportunities. Speaking from experience, of course. ||| same here. I have 1k in nano wallet and rest got sold for nice little profit few days ago. Waiting for drop in price to buy back more. ||| Pretty funny..what we want to know is who presses the up or down button.?   Is it truly (us).the market, or the man behind the curtain? ||| This is gold. The intro had everyone nail biting for sure. ||| ""I have a fear of selling xrp around $15 and xrp hitting $10,000 a coin a year later.""

XRP right now has a market cap of [150.000.000.000](http://150.000.000.000) USD. XRP at a prize of 10k USD a coin would translate to a market cap of 600.000.000.000.000 USD. Bitcoin right now has a market cap of 2.000.000.000.000 USD. So a prize of XRP at 10k would mean that XRPs market cap would need to hit 300x the market cap of bitcoin. Very optimistic bitcoin forecasts predict a market cap of like 20.000.000.000.000 USD until 2030, which equals the current market cap of gold and is around 9-10x higher than bitcoins current market cap.

Do you see how unrealistic your expectations for the ripple prize are? The prize has no meaning at all. What you need to consider is market capitalization. ||| Okay, so im really not picking here at you... it sounds like you don't really have a trading plan in place other than to take longs.  I just read through the shred...  lots of good advice in here.

If i were a young man I would take a percentage of my contributions and develop x plan for x percentage amount and x percentage stop loss to catch the bad runs.  Since I'm an older guy with not much put away I'm using really aggressive trading styles to catch up to my peers...  

So, longs:  60 percent is.the magic number to hold in the position. 
Shorts: 20 percent:  This is the number you use to bet against the market (if youre a short sale guy.. typically pple shynaway from shrts).
Momentum:  10 percent.  So this is where it's eyes on charts, in and out of trades in as little as 15 seconds to a couple of minutes on very high volitility days.

Swings: 10 percent.  Set to work for a few days, then take the profit. Repeat.

Set all stop losses to your comfort zone.  I do 15 percent but I'm pretty active... you need to set a stop loss goal for sure though. 

That's a loose plan that would need to be practiced on paper money for a month or two and refined as you learn more about the trading game.

Rules rules, rules.....
You need clear, short easy rules.  Example:  When I momentum trade the Williams R needs to be at or just above (not below) the 70 line, the macD fast line crossing the average and the momentum lines (or be above momentum line). That's a hard rule for me....

Ill die on my sword here:  If you don't have rules for yourself to follow trading your hard earned money, please then go have more fun gambling at Vegas because that's what you're doing, gambling.

Happy trading, man, wishing you well. ||| Not surely.

Reddit,XRP,1h7poo8,2024-12-06 01:28:45,"David Sacks announced as crypto and AI czar Welp, it’s official—David Sacks is the new Crypto and AI Czar. I guess all those rumors about Brad Garlinghouse taking the spot were just wishful thinking. Don’t get me wrong, Sacks is cool and all (PayPal Mafia and whatnot), but man, I really thought Brad would be the one.

Brad’s been in the trenches with crypto, dealing with regulators, advocating for the industry, and actually building something with Ripple. Sacks, on the other hand, has more of a general tech and startup vibe. It just feels like a missed opportunity to have someone so deeply tied to the crypto space leading the charge.

Anyone else kinda let down by this? Do you think Sacks will surprise us, or are we gonna end up wishing they’d gone with Brad?","Never in my life did I think it would be brad, it’s better that it isn’t , we get to stay more lowkey ||| What? Nobody thought it was going to be Brad. What a severe conflict of interest. ||| I’d rather have Brad right where he is. ||| Brad ain’t leaving Ripple to take that spot ||| Conflict of interest ||| This is great news for Solana potentially though as Sacks had a large stake in it before. Not sure if he sold off his stake though. ||| I didn’t think Brad was in the running for it tbh… ||| when has trump ever hired someone based on merit vs ass kissing? ||| Probably not a great thinks Sacks was chosen since he's very afraid of CBDC or technology that might be used in the future to support it. He also has very low opinions of people who sees are a part of the globalist elite and Garlinghouse and his association with the WEF puts him into this category. ||| I thought it was going to be Brad but, who did David work for?

In this administration?  Say it ain't so. ||| Clearly something this administration cares very deeply about. /s ||| Brad and David are bffs? Where did you see this? ||| Ripple's product is a backend replacement for Swift, nothing to do with CBDCs. If it facilitates CBDCs that's a kind of incidental, because it facilitates fiat too. That just shows it's versatility. In a way, if CBDCs were introduced they woukd likely have no need for ripple since the CBDCs would have the international transfer element covered within their own code.

Hello, I bought a 100 bucks worth of Ripple in 2018 and it has been sitting in a gatehub wallet ever since. I have now tried to regain access to the account, but ive been locked out. I have emailed them 20 times and no one responds. I have the gatehub recovery key but I do not have the XRP secret key or anything.

Does anyone have luck with gatehub responding? I am panicking because I could be sitting on a lot of money in there. Thank you all.","Never keep anything on an exchange in any amount that will make you cry.  I started with Binance when they first began, knowing they were in China. I made sure to get all of my XRP out. But back then Ledger only supported a handful of crypto. So I had purchased VET at 0.005 cents.
Vechain did have a wallet, but it did get hacked.  When Bianance US opened up, because I was in a state that did not allow Crypto, I was told because I had the account for so long I would be grandfathered in. Then all of a sudden they started sending me notices that I had to close the account. When I tried to contact them as to why, because I was told I was grandfathered in, there was no one to talk to on the phone, you had to leave your phone number. And because it was in China, they would call back at three in the morning and I would always miss the call. Luckily, there wasn’t much in that account. But I have been trying for the past week, to see if it’s still exists because I can now legally have a Binance US account. I’m curious to see how much that VET is worth. But because I never trade with money I can’t lose, and never kept more on an exchange that would make me cry if I lost it, I don’t lose any sleep over it. ||| I have logged in several times last days.

They also sponsor the knvb (dutch football association) and i have hold them in an high regard.

Reddit,XRP,1h6jj1e,2024-12-04 16:01:03,"Should Ripple target EBay as a Partner or customer? eBay could potentially benefit from using Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency to reduce costs associated with cross-currency transactions. Here’s how XRP could help eBay cut costs:

~2mil USD in savings per 1 million transactions annually 

Reduced Transaction Fees
XRP transactions are extremely cost-effective, with the average transaction fee being only 0.00001 XRP (approximately $0.000005 at current rates). This is significantly lower than traditional payment processing fees, which could result in substantial savings for eBay and its users, especially for high-volume international transactions.

Faster Settlement Times
XRP transactions are processed and confirmed within 3-5 seconds on average. This rapid settlement could greatly improve eBay’s payment processing efficiency, reducing the time and resources needed for managing transactions.

Elimination of Nostro Accounts
By using XRP as a bridge currency, eBay could potentially eliminate the need for pre-funded nostro accounts in various currencies. This would free up capital and reduce the costs associated with maintaining multiple currency accounts for international transactions.

Enhanced Liquidity
XRP provides on-demand liquidity, which could significantly reduce liquidity costs for eBay. Ripple claims that using XRP can cut liquidity costs by up to 99%. This could be particularly beneficial for eBay’s cross-border transactions, allowing for more efficient use of capital.

Auto-Bridging Capability
XRP’s auto-bridging feature could automatically find the most cost-effective path for currency conversions. For example, if a user needs to convert USD to MXN, the system could automatically use XRP as an intermediary if it’s cheaper than direct conversion. This could result in better exchange rates for eBay users and potentially increase profit margins for the platform.","I mean....they are kinda working the ""From the Top"" style of work (I'm talking about Ripple).

So...that would mean it would make more sense to work with whoever's the owner of the payment services Ebay uses, no?

Just thinking out loud \*shrug\*

EDIT: Btw. Any/every company that does its job over multiple countries/continents can benefit, so you're right. ||| They would be better off trying to partner with a payment platform (like Google Pay/Wallet, PayPal, Square, etc.) ||| Good idea byt find someone else to partner with.

Reddit,XRP,1h65dzx,2024-12-04 02:27:10,"WTF EXACTLY IS RLUSD  
Can somebody explain exactly wtf this is and what it does. I’ve done my own research so don’t tell me that shit. I understand 90% of what it is, why it is, and how it is. I’m trying to get more information and to know how it’s going to affect $XRP. Please leave your thoughts below.","It will be Ripple’s stable coin pegged to the USD. Basically means Ripple is putting up their own equity  to roll out a stable coin - utilizing the XRPL. Shouldn’t affect OTC prices of XRP initially, but it ties up some of the total supply of XRP, possibly contributing to an eventual increase in price due to a lesser total supply. 

I may be off but that’s my lay understanding. ||| This is from a post in XRP reddit and is spot on!!

How RLUSD and XRP Are Used (EXPLANATION)

I noticed a lot of people asking questions about **RLUSD**, and **how it will affect** **XRP**, how does it work and so on, so I decided to compile the most important information in a very easy way to understand it.

# RLUSD (Stablecoin):

* It's a digital version of the US Dollar, pegged 1:1 to a real dollar.
* You use it like digital cash for transactions, but it stays tied to the Dollar's value.
* It's great for sending or receiving money **if the sender and receiver both want to deal in Dollars**.

# XRP (Bridge Currency):

* XRP is designed to **connect different currencies** (like RLUSD, Euros, Yen, etc.) and move value quickly and cheaply across borders.
* It's not pegged to any currency, it has its own market value.
* You use it when you need to send money between currencies or across systems (e.g., RLUSD in one place, Euros in another).

But wait, why should I use **XRP** if there will be **RLUSD**??

* If you're staying in **one currency (like RLUSD → RLUSD)**, XRP isn’t needed.
* But if you’re moving between **different currencies or systems**, XRP is the bridge that makes it all work seamlessly and cheaply.

Think of RLUSD as **digital cash** for Dollars, and **XRP** as the **global courier** that connects everyone. They work together in many cases, but they also serve different purposes depending on the transaction.

If it's still confusing, I will give an easy example.

In the real world, there are over **180 currencies** (like Dollars, Euros, Yen). Banks need to hold huge amounts of money in every currency to send money around the world. It's expensive and slow.

* XRP acts as a **bridge currency.**
* If someone in the U.S. wants to send $1 million to Japan, instead of needing both Dollars and Yen, they convert $1 million into **XRP**.
* The XRP is sent to Japan, and there, it’s turned into Yen.
* This is faster and cheaper because banks only need **XRP as the bridge**, not every currency in the world.
* RLUSD is like a **digital version of a dollar**.
* It’s backed 1:1, meaning every RLUSD is supported by a real dollar in a bank.
* This makes it safe and trustworthy.
* You can use RLUSD in the **digital world** (on the XRP Ledger or Ethereum) instead of cash.

Think of **XRP** as the **super-fast** delivery truck and **RLUSD** as the digital money it carries safely. Together, they make global money transfers easier, cheaper, and much faster. Instead of 6,000 different currency combinations (Dollars to Yen, Euros to Pesos, etc.), banks just need **XRP as a bridge. RLUSD** makes the dollar ready for this digital system too, so people can easily use it online.

Now, **what will happen once RLUSD** **launches**?

The launch of **RLUSD** could indirectly strengthen the **XRP** market, but the magnitude of the impact will depend on how quickly **RLUSD** gains adoption and integrates into real-world financial systems. 

**Expect some short-term excitement but** **focus on long-term utility for sustainable effects on XRP.**

HOPE THIS HELPS! <3 ||| Think of it as a KYC/AML compliant version of Tether ||| It’s a stable coin. It’s like ripple version of usdt ||| It might be better for you to tell us what that remaining 10% is that you don't understand, so we don't bother you by telling you what it is, despite you asking what it is. ||| RLUSD is a Tether Killer ||| Ok this is how I understood it.

1.	RLUSD (but a multi-chain stable coin) enables seamless transactions on eth’s ecosystem
2.	XRP’s volume surges due to network demand.
3.	The increased utility directly boosts XRP’s price in the long run. ||| It’s crypto ||| Think of it as a US Dollar that requires you to use XRP to perform transactions with it.

...and also something about how the ledger works to tie it all together faster than other platforms, while also allowing those plarltforms to use ripples chain.  There was a piece about cross utilization and functionality between coins that ripple is apparently doing...

I'll try to dig up that article again...

Edit...  this is what i was trying to describe.

Oh... and ""real time settlement' is a key phrase in the ripple environment that is apparantly a big shot in the arm for ripple vs competitors...  see the article.

Cheers! ||| what i understand, it will be a type of burning the XRP supply. so bought fo fun haha ||| Stablecoin on xrp blockchain, it means tied to currency like USD or perhaps BRICS, either way it gives legitimacy to the project. Legitimacy = $8 ||| Let's think of Ripple XRP (XRP) and Ripple USD (RLUSD) in terms of a \*public transportation system\*.



\### \*XRP: The Ticketing System\*

Imagine XRP as the essential \*ticketing system\* of a bustling city's metro network. Here are its unique functions:

\- \*Transaction Fees\*: Just like you need a ticket to board the train, XRP is required to pay transaction fees on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This ensures that only legitimate transactions occur, preventing spam.

\- \*Reserve Balance\*: Similar to how a metro card must maintain a minimum balance to remain active, every account on the XRPL needs to hold a minimum amount of XRP. This helps maintain the integrity of the network by ensuring only serious participants are on the ledger.

\- \*Decentralization\*: Just as the ticketing system is decentralized and used across all metro stations, XRP is decentralized and used across all nodes in the XRPL, ensuring a robust and secure network.



\### \*RLUSD: The Comfortable Trains\*

Now, think of RLUSD as the \*comfortable trains\* running on the metro tracks:

\- \*Stability\*: Like a train that provides a smooth and stable ride, RLUSD offers a stable value pegged to the US dollar. Passengers (users) know they can rely on RLUSD to retain its value, making it ideal for transactions and remittances.

\- \*Ease of Use\*: Just as passengers board trains for a convenient commute, users choose RLUSD for easy and predictable transactions. Its USD-pegged value makes it a practical choice for everyday use.

\- \*Institutional Adoption\*: Just as the introduction of new, high-speed trains can attract more commuters, RLUSD can attract more institutional investors looking for a stable and regulated digital asset.



\### \*Working Together:\*

\- \*Enhanced Experience\*: The combination of a reliable ticketing system (XRP) and comfortable trains (RLUSD) creates a seamless and efficient transportation experience (Ripple ecosystem).

\- \*Increased Ridership\*: As the metro system (Ripple ecosystem) improves with the introduction of new trains (RLUSD), more people (users and investors) are likely to use it, benefiting both the ticketing system (XRP) and the metro network (XRPL).



In summary, XRP and RLUSD work together to enhance the Ripple ecosystem. XRP ensures the integrity and security of the system, while RLUSD provides stability and ease of use for transactions, much like how a well-functioning metro system combines an efficient ticketing system with comfortable trains. ||| Burning XRP in the background, credibility, more revenue (for acquisitions and stronger partnerships) and securing Ripple as the most trusted and reliable company in the crypto currency market.

This is actually really big news for XRP I expect another huge spike in the next few days. ||| I have been watching XRP since 2020; paying special attention to how it was treated after Hinman wrote a paper in the fall of 2018 that Ethereum was not a Security.. It seemed at the time that XRP met all of the same standards (or similar standards) as did ETH but that XRP was 'not allowed' to compete with ETH or BTC; even though it was the 6th largest cryptocurrency.. Since 2020, it seems like XRP's value has been held down (artificially?) but speculator's (like me) 'speculate'.

There isn't anything real about your statement, either. 

This is reddit. A place for a bunch of fuckfaces talking shit. Taking it it any way else, is your own problem. 


You didn't take his question for what it was..... you took it for how you thought it should be.

And grow up? This is reddit... i have probably taken shit older than you. I only need to act future when the REAL time calls for it....  and it certainly ain't here.....with people talking shit about how much they pretend to know about XRP, or any crypto for that matter. ||| And if ""you're hurt just say so"" comment.... sounds like you take a growing up lesson too.... be gone, now. Peace. ||| Everything I said was real. The fact that you see it any other way tells me once again you have a lot of growing up to do and clearly the show fits you since you had to make a response to it a day later, let alone 2 comments back to back. It tells me I most likely hurt you as well. If you felt that you probably have “taken shit older than me” then you wouldn’t have responded at all. Especially someone who claims to be older. Clearly an older person has less life experience than someone a bit younger. Try again and grow up because if you claim “you act when real time calls for it” why make 2 comments back to back from an old conversation? You are not gonna finish this so I highly suggest you hold the L and move on. Try not to get hurt next time. ||| How do I know what you said was ""real""? Because you said so...who are you? 

So.... because i don't see it YOUR way...means I have growing up to do..... let that sink in...make that make sense. 

Again....when REAL time calls for it... this ain't it. This is reddit....see what we are doing here?

If you're hurt just say so. 🤣🤣

If you act like an asshole, you getbtreat like one. It's annoying isn't it? 

At the end of day....this is all going to mean fuck all....and nothing. Treating it any other way is misguided. ||| Highly suggest.... or what? What if i dont.... dont block me....pleeeease!!! 🤣🤣🤣 ||| How do you know what I said was not “real”? See how you made yourself a hypocrite?

Nobody said anything about not seeing it my way, but then you’re the one making comments against assuming I’m saying something that’s not valid. Make it make sense. 

You said when real time calls for it this ain’t it, but once again you’re here with 2 more back to back comments worrying about an old conversation. So see what YOU are doing here too?


You claim I’m hurt but once again, you commented on an old conversation that was done and made 2 back to back comments. So who’s the one that’s really hurt? Make it make sense.

You claim I’m the asshole which clearly means you didn’t truly read the old conversation that you’re defending to begin with not realizing that he was the asshole. Which means the shoe really does fit you for not seeing he’s the asshole and call me the asshole. 

Every point I made specifically points to you being a hypocrite. Good job 😂😂. Keep proving how hurt you are with 2 more comments to show your emotions since we both know I’ll be in your head for a little while ||| Seesaw has nothing else to do in life, he will be thinking about this until next week ||| I dont know if it's real or not.....it's speculation. I know you as well you know me. 

You said if I saw it any other way, then...(your comment) youre flat out LYing now...

I know full well what I'm doing... I'm having fun...this ain't real shit ..it's reddit

I never claimed you're hurt, only asked.....

I never claimed you're asshole...but acted like one...twisting my words much? ""old conversation""? It's only been two days...its still pretty fresh.

My emotion is only joy on here...

Watching you twist my words up into something I didn't say... piece of work you are. ||| You knew saying the same shit seesaw. You need to find something new today ||| Good that you know that.

Nope, you just failed to understand the context of that wording. You flat out can’t read now…

You flat out lying now, what you’re doing is you’re butthurt because the show fit you and you can’t hide your emotions over the internet. An “older” man…

Nope no word twisting, the shoe does fit you as proven. 2 days old is still the past. Still an old conversation that was finished between two people.

Nope, like I said you’re literally proving to me that you are hurt. You are not having fun. The emojis will only help you look like you’re having fun.

Have a good day. ||| You know what they say about train wrecks. 🤣🤣

But anyways. Don't ask these fuckers about RLUSD or XRP. Just read up on it while you can. 

They say they know what's up. No one does, only the people that wrote the software for it knows. 

All we are is peanut gallery

The only question for is, after your research, are you willing to buy a few slices. 

I had my risk reward answer long ago. And I'm still in it.

Poor things have nothing else to worry about in life. 

But yes. You’re right, I’ve got a bag in XRP. I’m not new to it either, just was wondering maybe someone can give me more info on it that I didn’t know.

Reddit,XRP,1h63doq,2024-12-04 00:50:05,Finally got it back! I started using Binance to buy XRP in 2018 and then I fell off of it and forgot about it. I had a friend recently tell me it was skyrocketing but I no longer had access because I was trying to access from an US IP. A VPN and a transfer later I have it back and on Coinbase!,"I need to do this.  I had to use a VPN to get access to mine, as well. ||| Yea I bought shit years ago in Binance before the en/us split, saw the crash when I was greedy and took it as a loss. I said fuck it and let it sit in the old binance.

Saw the news about BTC 100k and I saw that everything was up and so I relogged into my accounts and transferred everything from binance to coinbase. 

I didnt verify on binance so I was limited on what I was about to transfer daily, but slowly I got it all here. ||| whoa crazy. What is the reasoning behind this? Thought binance US was cool with xrp? ||| So my finance still has my stuff on it? I hadn’t logged in in years and then I tried and I thought it was closed for US people. ||| So glad I happened to check this subreddit and come across this thread. Bought and left some crypto on Binance back in 2018 and didn't follow the market again until years later (long after the big change happened with Binance in the US). Just assumed my coins have been long gone. Now I have some hope! Thanks! ||| Same problem here. I heard a VPN could potentially freeze your account for good. Obviously, that must not be true. I am about to fly down to SA to just access it if I need to. ||| Are we all just login back into old and forgotten coins? I can't find my nano ledger. I found the 24 keys just need the device. ||| I had the same issue but the other day I was able to transfer it back without a vpn. Just log into binance and follow instructions. I got stuck a few times but it worked. I have very little computer knowledge so if I could do it then I’m assuming anyone can. Good luck. ||| Offline paper wallets have worked for tbh. ||| Lucky you, I had mine in toast wallet, forgot about it and recently remembered, tried sending it out to another wallet.

Mine is still in various wallets and on Binance.en.  Every once in a while I log in to check balances but haven’t transfered for fear of my Coinbase account being locked up. ||| Jc, Coinbase wallet?

Back then I would have to buy BTC or ETH on Coinbase and then send it to Binance to convert to XRP.  Another fun fact is that I think the reserve requirement was 20 back then so anytime you created a new wallet you lost 20 XRP.  I read recently they reduced it to 10, and now it’s only 1 XRP. ||| It is. But if you use a VPN you can access it ||| Were you successful? ||| If you have stuff there you can transfer it out I just did it two weeks ago no VPN needed. ||| I'd rather go deeper and have just offline paper wallets back.

My stuff was with Coinex so I thought I was really in a bind.  Moved everything to Ellipal with a VPN.

Reddit,XRP,1h5pmzk,2024-12-03 15:13:01,"Rippex - cold storage Hi all!
7-8 years ago I printed out a list of the top 25 cryptocurrencies at the time and threw a dart arrow. The arrow landed on Ripple / xrp and I ended up buying what today would be considered a sufficient amount. 

At the time of buying I used a program called Rippex as interface to the blockchain, which is no longer existing. All passwords / keys / seeds whatever were written down by hand on a piece of paper, which further was put in an envelope before being locked up inside my safe. I remember doing a check some years back (after rippex ended), that the coins were still registered at the same address in the chain, which they were. I guess that should be comforting? 

What software can be used if I would like to access my coins for further transferring them to Coinbase / Binance or similar?

Any guidance would be much appreciated. I am at a point in my life when it would make sense to sell some of it, given the recent price development.","I would recommend using Xaman ||| xamann wallet =) ||| Get yourself a hardware wallet. I would never trust a software wallet unless you can afford to lose it all. ||| Thank you! ||| Even hard wallets have their issues… Look at how many times ledger has had issues and compromises. I am terrified to even look on ledger for fear that something could’ve gotten compromised. ||| As I understood it at the time of arranging this, Rippex was just software for easy access to the blockchain. As long as I have my address, seeds and passwords stored offline, this should be just as safe as a hardware wallet. Am I wrong? ||| I feel that. I'm planning to spin up a Windows virtual machine or whatever gives me isolation from threats when I need to do any transactions with my ledger. ||| Absolutely. As long as you never reveal those to anyone or any piece of software, you are secure. I personally just don't trust any of these software wallets or my ability to recognize all attack vectors.",18,8

If you don’t believe that, then buy when you think it’s lower than when you would need to sell to achieve a major goal.

It might be possible, but it will take many years as to reach $500. If that’s your goal, buying at $2 to get x250 your investment this price isn’t so bad.

Yes. As a US-based company, we are bound by US Securities laws and specific regulations set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

There is an inherent risk with ANY investment, especially ones that require accreditation. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.

I'm sure this sub is annoyed with the Toast Wallet posts, but I have a quick question that I can't seem to find the exact answer too.  I have my recovery pass phrase, but I can't seem to find my backup.  I was wondering if there is a backup file that I could have possibly saved somewhere? I found the below folder on an external drive of mine that has a full backup of my old PC.   The folder is called ToastWallet\_Vbunchoflettersnumbers.  Would I be able to use anything or can I look for anything since I have full backups of my old PC's?

Fees on altcoins vary depending on liquidity. Newly-supported or small cap tokens are typically less liquid and incur higher fees.

During periods of increased volatility, our fees will increase. We hold each price open for 18 seconds. 

Our pricing also factors in the risk we are taking by holding inventory.

When market spreads are unusually wide (over 4%), we display an in-app notification so you can choose whether to go ahead or not.

Spreads on EUROC are wider than other Stablecoins due to higher volatility and limited liquidity.


—-

You might compare the spreads on Coinbase and Robinhood to see if it would be more profitable to transfer XRP and off ramp elsewhere. Bear in mind the volatility and volume right now. ||| Buy and sell with limit orders not market ||| Yup, the spread is crazy sometimes. I'll give you a quick example. I purchased 3500 XRP when the price was 2.38 and the spread was $0.10. So yeah, that XRP purchase price was $2.48. I'm just happy it kept on going up. ||| Set a limit order ||| Wait till prices really start getting up there, hearing all kinda bullshit they are doing. I’m on Robinhood and spreads aren’t that bad but wanting to hold most for long term because XRP will be massive in years to come ||| Coinbase pro, or prime… whatever it is, I think you get a reduced rate 🤷‍♂️ I may be wrong ||| It amazes me that people don’t know about spread, and can’t seem to figure it out using common sense ||| how do you get a post though in this sub? does anybody have this figured out?

That .10 spread was a bit too much for me lol ||| is asking why they do it not using common sense to inform myself? I don't live and breathe crypto investing every day. Does it make you feel like a smart big boy talking down at people?

Googled it and the best answer was from a Reddit comment. ""Spread is the difference between bid and ask (buy price and sell price). Its how the crypto exchange makes money. In times of low volatility the spread is low, and in high volatility its high, usually. As volume spikes and more traders trade, the spread is wider to capitalize on this.

I went to Uphold's website, searched the word ""Fee"", and clicked on the link that came up. It had exactly what this friendly user shared. Take this as a learning opportunity to learn about the websites you use, the programs you sign up for, and the financial implications of the decisions you make. It's critically important so you don't get screwed over by some corporation out there who does exactly what they say they'll do. Best of luck out there. ||| even though it hit 2.78 it didn't execute.

Is this the wrong time to buy? I'd like to get a financial advisor but again things are rather tight financially, trying to get back on our feet. Just looking for some advice, maybe guidance. I really appreciate the help. I've watched some YouTube videos and stuff but to be honest I feel like this might need a little more than a few videos, I don't need to lose even more. I greatly appreciate anyone for any advice they are willing to share.

I think crypto is still great but there’s a chance to lose a lot as well. Xrp likely will climb but a lot of us have been holding for years and it just recently started surging. ||| Don’t put your family’s future in crypto if you’re unsure or cannot handle the volatility. Please speak to a professional financial advisor and not reddit. ||| Investing in crypto when it is on a rip right now and just because you ‘heard’ about it is a sure way to lose money. That’s how the majority end up losing and end up coming to Reddit to complain that crypto is for hucksters, grafters etc when clearly it is not. ||| Crypto isn't the way to secure financial freedom.

It's a gamble and worth having a small percent of a fund held in it but there's a risk you lose. Potentially a lot/all of it. 

Not because the tech isn't great but it's just hyper volatile and so reliant on politicians. 

A small nod by trump can cause a huge spike.

If he changed his mind tomorrow and said he thought it was junk it'd collapse. ||| Get a financial advisor and stay off of Reddit.  No one should put anything into crypto they can’t afford to lose completely and you have a family to take care of. ||| Keep in mind that crypto is volatile. And I don't think anyone is eligible to give a financial advice. ||| Bro holy shit I need to get off this sub ||| Whatever u do, i hope u find ur fortune brother, may lord give health wealth and happiness to you and your family ||| A bull run is a result of fomo, greed and positive sentiment. Do not fuck about with crypto as a family investment, your desire to make the price go up will not make it so. In every bullrun millions of first timers get wrecked thinking it’s some sort of financial renaissance, invest what you can as fun coupons but do not put good money in here anticipating some of life changing experience.

For context I am also a father. Not a 15 year old coin chirper. ||| I got my financial advise from a bear, a smiley face, and some joker. They all said accumulate and persevere. ||| I invested $5000 into a few dif cryptos late 2021/early 2022. DCA’d for a couple months. Then stopped putting any more of my own money in because things just kept dropping. I continued to hold tight, and just finally got out of the red for the first time yesterday…..

Just a heads up. ||| Im not a financial advisor and this isn’t financial advice but I would consider looking into something like VOO (Vanguard ETF.) Not crypto but solid gains annually. ||| Never risk anything you can't afford to lose.  Same goes for stocks.

Step 1 should be to make sure you establish an emergency fund in a savings account.

Crypto is NOT a money printing machine.  It's volatile, and people lose their life savings on it.  

If you are in a position to put money in, do it methodically.  I personally have a rule not to chase prices.  So I'm not buying right now.  

And that would be my number 1 piece of advice for investing anything.  never chase. ||| Read the first crypto introduction by SATOSHI back in 2007 back then it was known as fiats. Then you can decide. If you decide to buy hold long term ||| XRP is increasing in value right now.  I am up almost 6X my initial investment from 90 days ago.  My only regret?....I wish I had bought more! ||| I would advise to DCA, crypto will likely go up quite alot over the next few months and the drop dramatically. If you start DCAing after the hype has died down and do so over the next 4 years you should be ready for the next bull run, don't try to time the market, research over the next few years while you add what you can afford, personal opinion. Hope your finances improve. ||| ""Secure their future by buying highly volatile and unpredictable crypto coins""? Dude.. ||| Nobody is an expert so do your own research. Don't watch YouTube crypto content, they have no idea what they're talking about. Only invest into crypto what you can afford to completely lose. Don't pay a financial advisor.

If you buy crypto, make sure you can keep it in the market for 10+ years. BTC in my opinion is the safest bet.

*“The stock market is a device to transfer money from the 'impatient' to the 'patient*'.” Warren Buffet.  
""Our favorite holding period is forever.” *Rather, the point is that you should not hold a stock in the short term if you are not willing to hold it for the long term. Buffett prefers to hold a stock “forever.” Warren* Buffet.

The concept is similar for Crypto, don't try to time the market. You will lose.

Best of luck to you and your family. Congrats on beating cancer. Focus on health and your family. ||| The usual 
Get term life insurance. 
Setup a will. 
Open UTMA accounts for each kid and put an amount that you can afford into each one. Let it grow and give it to them when they are 21.
Put 3% of net worth into crypto. (I’d diversify and stick to the top 3 coins personally)
Use your retirement match at work if they have it. 
Put anything else you can afford into an Ira monthly(Roth if income is low enough)
Look for passive income streams. ||| I would say buying at a high is never a good idea, however I believe that the price can double from where it is now within the next 6 months.

  
Another thing to consider is that we are smack in the middle of a bull run, the best time to buy is during a calmer part of the cycle which would be around mid 2026, I don't want anyone to get FOMO but I think 2025 is going to be massive for the crypto market, BTC at 150k, ETH round 8k and XRP at $5ish, bear in mind all these figures will reduce when the cycle ends and we have a multi-year pullback.  BTC went from its ATH to under $5k but look at it now, it will double its previous ATH in 2025, pretty crazy stuff, be careful.

  
Don't put all your eggs in one basket!  That doesn't mean buying 3 different cryptos, it means investing in things which are not crypto. ||| The thing about XRP is that it isn't crypto, it's a token. A token used to utilize the XRPL Ledger. This token will keep going up because of its utility. I don't have billions of dollars to buy in, and I doubt any reddit users do as well. So where is this momentum coming from? Banks and other financial institutions. Ripple is just getting started. ||| Especially on reddit or youtube! Like parenthood, trading crypto is impossible experience to pass on with videos, tutorials and trainings. You need to burn yourself couple times before you understand the market and your emotions. Everyone will tell you, trade only what you are willing to loose. And you will 100% of it.

In your situation, stay away from it. Seek professional financial advisor help, build up some savings, go long term with ETFs, maybe properties.

Good luck. ||| I had ripple for 7 years and so stupidly sold last week.. big regret seeing the chart now. You can never tell with crypto ||| Appreciate that, thank you. ||| True that.

Believe me, I've been where you are and have walked a similar sad and often lonely path. I almost lost my 2nd wife to Leukemia (AML) roughly 25 yrs ago now. However, our insurance wouldn't cover the ONLY treatment left to us that was needed to try and save her life because, at that time, it was considered ""experimental"" (though NOW it's covered under most insurances). Which left me to have to sell literally everything of value, plus take out loans, in order to afford the treatment. Thankfully, the treatment worked and she eventually made a full recovery. Oh, I failed to mention that less than a yr before her cancer diagnosis, I survived being shot in the head while on duty as a cop during a drug bust gone horribly wrong. Unknown to me or my partner, this guy (who was with 5 others) was wanted for the murder of a young mother he gunned down with an AK-47 in front of her kids... And over a stupid ass $20 rock cocaine debt she owed him. 

So, I recover from that to then have to watch my (then) wife end up fighting for HER life, less than a yr later. But, it's not over yet, oh no. 


After standing by her side through all of this, I find out only later that she had been cheating on me and that she was even having him visit her AT the hospital during the times she knew I would be unavailable to visit her because of work and taking care of our children (I had no family to help me). Then, the topping on the cake.

She intentionally poisoned our newborn son and killed him. He died in my arms. The court refused to convict her and claimed it was ""temporary insanity brought about due to her cancer treatments"". She then immediately filed for divorce (AFTER emptying our bank account of all that was left) from me and demanded full custody and primary domiciliary rights. I fought this but lost here, as well. The judge said that ""It is 'well known' that, by nature, mothers are generally more caring and compassionate caregivers than are fathers"" and added that, despite the facts regarding the tragic loss of our newborn son, the court ""thought"" I ""should agree"" that my wife was to be ""commended"" for making such a ""remarkable and full recovery"" after all ""SHE"" had ""been through"".

He then granted me JOINT custody, but also giving her primary domiciliary rights as she had requested. He also added the stipulation that, while I was to have ""generous visitation rights"", that it was to be left up to HER to decide when, where and even IF I was to be given them. I TRIED to warn the judge that I feared she might flee with our older son (my other children where from my 1st divorce and she had NO say in them) but he refused to listen to me.


Sure enough, both he and she disappeared over 22 yrs ago now and I've not been able to see or speak with him since. He was only roughly 3 yrs old. 


Then, I lost everything in the back to back hurricanes of Katrina and Rita. My back was broken and, after awhile, I was able to finally get state aid for Medicaid but not for any welfare type income. So, I was able to eventually get back surgery to repair my now badly damaged back as much as possible. But it was one of my 2 best friends in the world who, despite not having much and not being originally from this country, took care of my financial needs and did so until I was able to finally battle back from having literally no pot to piss in and no window to throw it out of.


When I did go back to work, I promised myself I'd pay him back every time I owed him, even though he said it wasn't necessary. When I was able to sit down and write, and then send, to him that check which covered all that time he took care of me and my needs, was one of the happiest times of my life, outside of the birth of my children. My 3rd wife and I are about to celebrate our 20th anniversary. She had 2 young children from a previous marriage and we added 2 more daughters of our own to my growing list of children. I started, and sold, 3 different businesses, took care of paying my child support for all of my children AND my 2 step children because their father refused to pay any and, for SOME strange reasons, Calif (where he lived) didn't seem too interested in making him do so, either. He never saw them again after their mom and I married and told her that since I was apparently ""willing"" to be a father figure for them and to financially support them, then ""why should he need to worry about it?"". Both of them are now long since graduated from high school and moved away to start their own lives. Our last 2 are still at home, though not for long, as they're both going to be off to college in 2025 and 2026 respectively. Our youngest is in accelerated courses. She's a Junior in high school but most of her classes are in college where she's trying to get classes out of the way for her to start towards her ultimate career goal which is to become a Doctor.

She'll graduate from High school in 2026 and have a 2 yr college degree already, as well. Then, I've got the next 4 yrs of college (maybe more) already covered for her, as I've done for ALL my children if they wanted.

I've been down and out more times than I want to count (and, believe me when I say that I haven't even told you HALF of the, very serious, problems I've had to face and overcome in my lifetime) and yet, always managed to somehow pick myself up, dust myself off, and learned how to start all over again, often from nothing or next to nothing.

Along the way I got involved in crypto during its early years. I EASILY LOST more money than I made during those times and by a LOT, too. Almost gave up. But, I never gambled with money that I knew we couldn't afford to lose. I swore that to myself when I started and I've never gone back on that promise. Like with most things, the more involved I got, the more I learned and the more I learned, the less I got burned. Nothing beats experience....accept MAYBE luck😁.  Today, I now have a nice portfolio in precious metals, stones and, yes, crypto, as well. I and my family live in a nice 5 bedroom 4 1/2 bath, 5,400 sqft home valued at approx $1.3 million dollars. I own a 2021 Corvette, 2014 Silverado 4x4 Pick up truck, King Cab with only 45,000 miles, and a 2012 Chrysler Town and country van, touring edition, fully loaded and all of them fully paid for.

I have a nice 6 figure retirement income and, while I could think of a couple of things I'd sure like to have a bit easier these days (my health, for one), considering where I've come from and what I've been through, it's not that bad, I guess.

My point in all of this is simply that, while things might look (and might even actually BE) bad right here and now, tomorrow is always a new day filled with new opportunities. Question is, are you going to grab them or just watch them go by because you're so stuck in the moment that you let it weigh you down like a stone around a drowning man's neck?
It might be hard, but hell, whoever said that life was going to be easy?

Good luck, in all that you and your family are going through as well as in your financial pursuits.

 Not financial advice just my personal opinion(s). Always DYOR and never invest more than you can reasonably afford to lose.

Take care👍🤗❤️ ||| Thank you, I will take your advice. Just coming from nothing I've tried to build what I can. Want to try and make even larger. But I'll stick to coins, precious metals, and being a tech. I greatly appreciate you and the others giving sound advice. ||| Damn did you sell everything? How much did you have? ||| Follow the solid advice you're getting and don't listen to Reddit. Hearing good things about crypto right now is just like hearing about all the people that hit the jackpot in Vegas. Sure it happens, but there's a reason the casinos aren't going broke. It's 100% a gamble and no one can prove otherwise. ||| Something I like to abide by is 10%

I have some precious metals, when I bought into them it was 10% of what I was investing at that time.

For crypto, I did the same thing. In 2017, 10% of the cash i had set aside went to a few cryptos.

For stocks, I don't let myself buy a position larger than 10% of my portfolio.

It is self imposed and admittedly a limiting factor at times, but when I make a bad decision it doesn't decimate me. ||| If you’re serious, I’d start following the market from here. As far as buying, I would advise against it because we’re at some all time highs and some are getting ready to pop and others drop. If you put money in, consider it already gone. ||| Grab a spoon, some salt, and your own thinking cap. This is not financial advice, it's the rambling of someone who is speaking only to what they think they know; educate yourself and make your own choices.

Check out r/bogleheads, the community has a wealth of educational materials. Find books at your local library, or audiobooks using a library card. Seek reputable financial education sources. Bring your salt & thinking cap with you wherever you go. No matter what you decide to do moving forward- Do. Your. Due. Diligence.

Rough as it is, there aren't many, if any, free lunches out there; and the ones that seem free often come at a hidden cost. Again- due diligence. Know what you are buying, why you are buying it, and what your exit strategy is.

The path to wealth is a tradeoff of time and risk- if you want it fast, be prepared to lose it all; if you want it almost guaranteed, be prepared to wait.

Look at index funds with low correlations. Look at rules of thumb for bonds v stock/index allocations. Consider your own risk tolerance. Time in the market beats timing the market unless you have an information advantage. Don't assume you have the information advantage based on publically available information. Only buy stocks or crypto or other speculative investments with money you are willing to see diminish in value over the short term and potentially be erased. Markets go down and can take years to recover. Build up a savings account with ~6 months of expenses. Pay down high interest debt. Leverage tax-free investments through your employer or an IRA. Use the system and resources to your advantage, only when you understand them.

Take time to save and educate yourself, then decide how to move forward in a manner best suiting to your needs.

You and your family have faced extraordinary circumstances. There are resources available to help you. There is no shame in using food banks, government programs, or non-profit programs. Use the resources available to reduce the mental, physical, and financial burden on your family. Investigate local options, ask around, do some online searches.

Take time to enjoy life with friends and family. Take care of yourself and never be afraid to ask for help.

From one stranger to another- I believe in you. Even if some days you might need to take things ten seconds at a time, you'll make it through. Keep your head up and your wits about you. You will find your way through the obstacles ahead. ||| I had 3000 :( I don’t want to talk about it … ||| I was thinking about swapping some previous metals out for some other investments. ||| Appreciate the advice ||| I truly, and greatly, appreciate the advice and time you took for me. I've learned that truly time is it greatest asset. I just feel it's my duty to continue to provide for my family and take care of them. But I've got my own health issues going on. I'm not looking to get rich quick, I'm looking to build a portfolio that if I have to leave in a year, they have something. I've been going over things with my oldest son, trying to privy my wife to things. Which admittedly I'm still learning. I grew up in the system and just have been working to dig myself out of it. I would never use money that's needed for my family. I have been selling off things and wanted to try to put that money into something that could possibly build itself. I looked into life insurance but not sure they'll take me due to my health, so looking and exploring my options currently. Most likely going to just keep focusing on spending time, and making memories. At the end of it, that's what will matter I hope.

Just doesn't make any sense and prone to volatility and loss ||| A good question.

This is all one big auction house is all the market really is....  one buyer, one seller.

 The way the market works your scenario won't play out.  Example: When you buy on the exchange, you are locked in at that price, even though the price action is continuing to play out and other are getting a better dealnthan you...or maybe a worse deal...depending on the price action. Other ppl are buying at a different price than you got...end of story.

Likewise, you send me 10 bucks.  The exchange will send me the ten full dollars, but if its WORTH then full dollars at the exchange rate is another matter... it may be a little more, a little less.

Commodities trading and crypto trading are going to walk hand in glove in the methods used to control economies...  and it's largely due to volitility in the market trade.

Hopefully I explained this well enough.  Poke some holes, let's clear it up if needed. ||| As XRP’s adoption grows, liquidity increases, and its usage shifts toward utility-driven demand, the combined factors of fast transaction speeds, reduced speculation, and greater liquidity work to reduce price volatility further, making it a stable and reliable medium for cross-border payments ||| XRP cult in action man. They provide zero explanation, just “search on google” or “please do some research” with additional insults 🤷 As if the life of their mother depended on this topic ||| This is Reddit bro, don’t worry about my name, unless it’s coming out ya moms mouth 🤪 ||| XRP is not designed for people like us to send and receive. This is where the RLUSD stable coin comes into play which will be U.S. money only. 

XRP is designed for large institutions and banks to send cross border payments instantly with very low fees. It serves as a bridge currency. There are 150+ currencies in the world at the moment. XRP can be sent anywhere in a matter of seconds and will convert to any of those currencies. 

Now as for volatility, here is where regulation comes into play (to which we basically have none at the moment, but that will all be changing soon). Let's say a U.S. bank wants to send 10 million dollars to bank in Japan. Each XRP in this example is worth $100 USD. So the U.S. bank would need to send 100,000 XRP. That transaction would happen in about 4 seconds. Cleared and ready to go. My guess is the regulation would state that whatever it was sent as gets received for the same amount, for a duration of time. So that 100,000 XRP can now be converted into Yen which would equal the amount of the 10 million USD. ||| That’s where RLUSD comes into play, here nobody seems to understand this aspect you just presented ||| When you send XRP, the transaction is settled at the moment of initiation, meaning that once you broadcast your transaction, the transaction details, including the amount of XRP and the recipient address, are locked into the network’s ledger. While the market price of XRP could fluctuate during the few seconds it takes for the transaction to complete, the transfer itself is generally not subject to real-time market movements. In simple terms, once the transaction is confirmed by the network, it’s a final and irreversible action. ||| My example of using shares of a company may not be the best example. Regardless, one will still be exposed to 3 seconds of volatility through an RXP transfer as stated by the company's CEO. By the time the receiver sends the money, there could have been a large swing which change the value of the money that they are receiving. The losses could easily far exceed transaction fees of the Swift system. Using RXP will not work on a large scale ||| It will never be stable enough for financial institutions. That is why large institutions have never adopted it. They have stated it is two volatile. Anything that the market can speculatively trade on is going to be inherently too volatile. Sorry can become much more stable, but banks require absolute certainty and consistency ||| THANK YOU ||| Legend, bro, legend. ||| I just watched an interview where the CEO himself said that a transaction is susceptible to only 3 minutes of volatility. He tried to downplay it by saying it is much less than Bitcoin. Nonetheless you are still open to volatility mid-transaction ||| Have you ever wired USD? Same issue. ||| They are just quoting random topics: “banks already using”, “why are you here”, “why 1000xrp when you can use 1xrp”. Zero logic. ||| Yes, this is a true statement.  I don't think he 'downplayed' anything, but the fact that exposure to volitility in trades is a real thing, even in current stock markets.

I day trade on momentum. Meaning I'm in a trade for as little as 10 seconds.  I can literally buy a stock and get hammered by the volitility if I'm going the wrong way...

In your scenerio, the exposure is very, very limited, and even so, the other guy above referenced the method the price locks on the chain very well. ||| No. No it does not. Not even close, what are you talking about? The USD, ever, has a chance to fluctuate 10% within a day or even within a few minutes ||| Oh look it’s a two-man circle jerk - cute! ||| I agree the exposure can be very limited. But major institutions who are transferring hundreds of millions of dollars in a single transaction will not be open to that risk. There is no risk of volatility when transferring USD. They are not going to switch to a different system with that risk just to save on transaction fees ||| I dont think you're seeing it, or seeing too much of it...  they do this currentlynin the stock market right now, brother.  Today, this minute. Once the ledger locks, it locks.  And its damn near instant.  

The current stock market suffers the same lag in performance...right now.  So where you say he ""downplayed"" it, im seeing that it's ""on par with"" current trading. ||| Speculative trading is completely different scenario than transferring money. Large institutions will never allow a volatile token to be used as an exchange medium. ||| What are your failing to realize is The difference between purchasing the shares and transferring the money. 

Your share purchase is locked in, meaning $100 for example will get you 100 shares at $1 share, and that won't change during the transaction time. But what might change is that once the transaction is done, the stock had fallen and now you're 100 shares are only worth $90. The same thing can happen with XRP.

Between the time of receiving the XRP and then selling it for USD. The bank could easily endure losses that far exceed a transaction fee for Swift ||| Food for thought...

XRP has finally reclaimed its position among the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap, reaching levels not seen since 2018. What a ride so far.

The why? We can look at a few factors:

* Approval of Crypto ETF's including those relevant to XRP (WisdomTree)
* The recent U.S. presidential election outcome has led to expectations of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, boosting investor confidence in the space.
* The major components of the lawsuit are now behind us. XRP has LEGAL CLARITY, which cannot be said by  99.9999% of the space.

no reason to sell either.. holding shit this for another 7 years. ||| #2 is next! ||| This is fucking wild :) ||| Need y'all to re-educate me on Ripple. 

Based on my understanding, Ripple Lab's stablecoin is the golden ticket (i.e., the answer to the volatility of the crypto market which is what major financial institutions want to shield themselves from while opting for a more efficient and faster method of processing transactions compared to the legacy SWIFT). Meanwhile, XRP is used as another funnel for Ripple to raise capital. At the same time, while XRP can be used to facilitate these transactions, it's not the asset that's being adopted by financial institutions? ||| why so many haters? ||| for as much disdain I have for Musk, I wonder if there's going to be some tie-in to X ||| Coke and reelection ||| What's the use case or narrative to support XRP adoption and accumulation that justifies the upswing in market cap? I genuinely don't understand the demand for it since XRP doesn't offer anything more than the many other cryptocurrencies that do the same with fast/cheap transactions. I don't think XRP offers a DEFI ecosystem that demands the token. Even the CBDCs built on XRPL don't actually require the XRP token to operate...not that I'm a fan of CBDCs that will likely be used as a system of control to create a dystopian-like social credit system where money is tracked and controlled. I don't know why anyone would be in favor of CBDCs. I actually despise Ripple for helping to create that scenario with CBDCs. ||| are you me? ||| Same!

Been a long time! ||| TL;DR RLUSD is great for USD dominant financial institutions.  It is less good for cross border payments.  
  
Very valid question which I also I had.  RLUSD will work great if the banks are USD dominant since you are basically just converting digital USD > USD so no real slippage or conversion fees.  There are some global banks that might also want their transactions in USD.  

However, with Ripple's goal being cross border transactions many places, for various reasons, do not want to rely on USD.  It is also very inefficient to do EUR > RLUSD > USD > RLUSD > JPY.  That is effectively what using RLUSD would be.  It is much better to do EUR > XRP > JPY since XRP is a neutral asset.  XRPL has a pathfinding feature built in to help determine the best route.  It accounts for things like liquidity, exchange rates, fees, hops, etc.  They also offer the option for the user to specify the route. ||| ETH and SOL soy boys generally have a low constitution.

Like a rabbit, with a foot stuck in a bear trap, they are going through the denial phase and lashing out angrily. 

Time will come when they move into acceptance phase, naw their foot off and limp into the action (liquidate their ETH/SOLO meme coins and FOMO into XRP) driving up our OG positions.

The keep here is to remain humble; and only shit on them a little. ||| **X**rp, we should have seen that coming

I wanted to know where the demand for the XRP token was coming from that was driving the recent market cap increase...the answer to that, as I recently found out, is the announcement of a spot XRP ETF. ||| No, Ripple CTO David Schwartz said “there is an option for central banks to interact with or utilize XRP, but as I reported, banks using the platform do not need to use it"" as reported: [https://cryptoslate.com/ripple-cto-confirms-its-cbdc-platforms-ability-to-use-xrp-token/](https://cryptoslate.com/ripple-cto-confirms-its-cbdc-platforms-ability-to-use-xrp-token/) ||| I got Insta banned from BTC for “promoting a scam coin”.

Ripple partners with banks, Ripple leverages XRP. ||| The CBDCs you are describing is one specific offering Ripple engages in with partners, but not the only one and also not the main one. Its primary offering is RippleNet which allows banks to access instant liquidity for transfers, using XRP as the backing liquidity network. Yes, if we're being pedantic various cryptocurrencies can do cross border payments. Not all are fast and not all are cheap, but most importantly, none of those others are being adopted by banks. Ripple is the only one specifically partnering with banks, and Ripple uses XRP for its protocol. Do they have to? No, but they do, and XRP was specifically built with that use case in mind, which makes it pretty good at it. I suspect the RLUSD currency they're launching will serve as yet another tool along with XRP they can use to expand the variety of offerings or liquidity they can tap into for cross-bank payments. ||| Also EU has instant payment with sepa, and USA is working on its own solution. ||| Like I said... everything on the XRP Ledger uses XRP.

Continue to be of service to the world in someway, maybe take some time off, but then do something that’s meaningful to you and to others, rather than something that’s sucking the life out of you.Work on your terms or you will feel purposeless. ||| These are bagholder type posts lmao ||| The attitude of someone who will end up being exit liquidity. You will make more money in this market adopting a different mindset and not getting married to a narrative. ||| 7 years ago this was also said and they showed better arguments. Not even 1 usd. ||| Doesn’t the market cap at $100 something like 200 trillion ? More than any other companies in the world by a long shot ||| What is xrp going to be used for ? Why is it gold ? Seems like another btc wanna be , there’s not going to be 100 alt coins in the future if any. ||| No it's not! Max supply is insane..so by numbers it's impossible! ||| Ever heard about marketcap and global GDP? ||| Posts like this make me wanna sell. $100 XRP would represent eclipsing btc by several multiples. ||| So you think ripple is worth more than btc? ||| ADA is doing the exact same as XRP along with a dozen other coins. It just comes down to what you had in your wallet. Either way is great to see! ||| *gentlepeople 🙄 ||| 100 ?? No just do the math with the MC , YOU CANT BE × 7 BTC MC (AT LEAST NOT IN THAT FUCKING DECATE) ||| The most hilarious outcome is if Xrp has topped for the cycle and maxis watch as it falls from #3 to out of the top 10. ||| None of you guys understood how market cap works ||| 100... dollars?
No lmfao ||| How many shares have you accumulated over the years? Avg price? ||| I feel a bit cringe that I use to talk like this 5 years ago. ||| I believe in it ||| For XRP to Reach $100 anytime soon is impossible 🤣 the tokenomics aren't there at all. ||| Too early to say we found gold. Maybe we found bronze.. silver next. ||| You're delusional as hell lmao do you realize the market cap that would be needed for XRP to reach $100 per coin? ||| Lol love these posts. The delusional euphoria. ||| 100 cents? Please don’t tell me 100 dollars! You are completely batshit if you think that is gonna happen ever. ||| Why do all these posts sound like basement-dwellers aiming to exact revenge on peers who rejected them from their society ||| lol someone is new ||| Nonsense gambling on a random crypto currency. 🙄 ||| Read the same thing on the cro group ||| I am also optimistic about XRP. I am also holding TRX, BGB and MEMEFI among other altcoins. Is anyone taking in the trade volume challenge on Bitget to win 300 MAJOR, MEMEFI, TON or BGB? It seems like the perfect way to stay engaged this DEC. ||| You're not crazy dude. You're fresh as a daisy. ||| It's marketcap would have to be 15x what Bitcoin is now..... ||| I’ll buy if it breaks 3.50. ||| Impossible, real world use, solves a problem, there was no way it would fail, thats why they had to derail us all. 
I dont hold a bunch, but i think i hold enough to make my life more comfortable by paying off the house in a cpl yrs ||| That would a 10 trillion market cap theres more chance of it going to 0 ||| banks are falling apart, aren't loaning and need liquidity.

I WONDER WHO WOULD HAVE SOME OF THAT LIQUIDITY??? ||| Congrats on your unrealized 3x ||| It’s under $3 right now. Bahahaha ||| “Xrp and the road to 100” that has to be one of the dumbest statements in a long, long time.🤪🤪 ||| XRP will never hit 100 dollars ||| Go back 4 or 8 years in this subreddit and you’ll be reading the same ||| you mean about XRP or about their own coin of discussion lol ||| This one is different because he holds a bag! ||| That's why I bought a few of each and made 80% last week... 😂 ||| Ahahahahahah🤣😂 “ToO tHe MoOn” gang🤣🤦‍♂️ ||| Not just crypto but GME, AMC, MSTR etc. all echo chambers of hopium ||| lol for real ||| Bro's broken the first rule: don't daydream on unrealised gains. ||| Yes, show us your tits ||| Actually it has.
There is more money in xrp than ever.
The 2018 ATH had fewer coins to share it's value.
ATH was $120billion, we are now at $138billion. ||| I just spat out my tea laughing at that 🤣🤣 ||| ah I've been dealing with people like you for years...I still hope you own xrp . love yoy ||| Lol, it’s just done 340% in 3 weeks, ath is 30% away and this guy’s dumbing it down 😂 ||| 😂 ||| [deleted] ||| Market Cap doesn’t mean squat in Crypto.   For new members here (and maybe some old heads as well) check a look at Galagtron’s blog about MC here:  https://galgitron.net/Post/The-Myth-of-Market-Cap—Version-2

The essay “The Myth of Market Cap - Version 2” by Galgitron argues that market capitalization (market cap) is a misleading metric in the cryptocurrency space. Market cap is calculated by multiplying the last trade price of a cryptocurrency by its circulating supply. This simplistic formula can give a distorted view of a coin’s actual value and the amount of money invested in it.

Key Points:

Market Cap Doesn’t Reflect Actual Investment: A small trade at a higher price can significantly inflate the market cap. For example, if one Bitcoin is sold at a price slightly higher than the previous trade, the market cap can increase by billions, even though only a small amount of money was involved in the transaction.

Comparing Market Caps Is Misleading: Comparing the market caps of different cryptocurrencies doesn’t provide meaningful insights. Each cryptocurrency operates in its own context, and their market caps are influenced by various factors that aren’t directly comparable.

Market Cap Doesn’t Indicate Liquidity or Potential: A high market cap doesn’t necessarily mean that a cryptocurrency has high liquidity or potential for growth. It doesn’t account for the actual utility or adoption of the coin.

In summary, the essay emphasizes that market cap is a superficial metric that can be easily manipulated and doesn’t accurately represent the true value or potential of a cryptocurrency. Investors should consider other factors, such as utility, adoption, and underlying technology, rather than relying solely on market cap as an indicator of a cryptocurrency’s worth.


Market cap is for stocks, quit with this argument please. ||| What was the market cap of XRP’s ATH price ? ||| I wanna lose it all like the doge guy ||| Why would you trade to ETH though out of curiosity? It’s probably the slowest mover right now ||| So, im curious. Why are you here, then? You swapped it, forgot about it once, now plan to forget it again - and then you come to this sub reddit lol you're either trying to find things to convince yourself you made the right move, or...yeah that's my guess lol ||| aweeeee ||| LOL for eth... RIP ||| Don’t get me wrong, or get me wrong but I would rather chop off my foot. Hold your $XRP, earn on it, hell - buy more even. why would you go for $ETH NOW? ||| Took profits at 2.22 and here we are. Yes taking profits is good, but I’ve kept digging for answers and it just seems like this isn’t over yet. Always keep some chips on the table after taking profits. ||| trade my guy trade buy xrp is king ||| you ummm... you got some spare twisting for some more nipples?  
Mine are going crazy ATM ||| Idk if it’s instead. I’m pretty sure swift is working with ripple on integrating their tech within their business. ||| >Wait until many big institutions start using XRP instead of SWIFT

|-|-|-|-| ||| LETS GO MY GUYYYYYYYY ||| Why can't crypto market cap go that high? It's a new tech. Could get worldwide adoption. My avg is .25. Been in for 7 years. I don't know if $100 can happen, but I'm not saying no either. ||| Lots of people are bad at math.  https://marketcapof.com/ripple/bitcoin/ Is my friend. ||| ""mathematically"" dude this is the wild West, nobody knows sheit ||| Then it will be trillions! ||| YES TRILLIONS ||| You do know the fed now payment system is going to adopt xrp right? ||| The market cap isn't as relevant as you think ||| 10 trillion market cap, fully diluted, less the burn... $100 isn't impossible.. very unlikely though. it would need to do everything it set to accomplish and be the only world wide crypto transfer currency. 

Global payments in 2023 was 1.8Q (Quadrillion) USD.
If XRP were to capture 10% of all payments in say 20 years. With 25% of that volume held in reserves, you're looking at a $50 price tag. 

It's also important to understand once XRP is fully diluted it will become deflationary, so if we were to see those very significant payment volumes over the course of a 10 year period for example you could see meaningful increase in price without increasing the marketcap of the coin. 

If you want to say $100 price target in 30 years I won't push back on it, but never hitting $100 ...... Too early to say that imo ||| Yes, but because market cap (a metric used to value companies traded on the stock market), why should that be applied to digital currency? Shouldn’t it be a utility metric? Like volume times function ? Idk. ||| Xrp has several big partners like jp morgan currently handle up to $10 trillion daily alone. If XRP becomes widely used for these transactions, demand could grow significantly, likely increasing its price over time. $50 is more reasonable, $100 isn’t impossible tho. ||| Market cap does not apply the same to utility coins. It is too basic of an equation. does not take into account all the coins bought at lower levels and can be too easily manipulated by buying a single coin. People need to stop with this crap. ||| Ah the myth of market cap ||| I can send u some xrp if you don't have enough and feel left out ||| yes you get it ||| My best bet too. Will sell if it reaches 10 Dollars or close too.

At some point you just have to take profits and I've been holding for so long. ||| I purchased since 2017, right after my high school years. I was young and naive and said a loss is my loss but I’ll invest $50. I’m not gonna lie I was scared because back then you could only purchase in fiats and in China (Binance). You have no idea how stressful it was to purchase things in fiat on top higher fees and the transfer took forever. On top of that you couldn’t lose your secret code password and my laptop didn’t last long so everything was difficult. Now things are easier and trackable and easy to report taxes for this I’m so grateful! The reason I invested is because I was so addicted to Reddit hehe and still am it was well chatted especially by singers that made me want to invest. These singers are hiding their money most of them claimed they got no money but they expressively flaunt in on twitter ;)  (50 cents) yet he filed for bankruptcy so you can imagine how rich he is now….
Then goes snoop dog…

Now I’m up to $12K. 

People talk nonsense, do your own research and invest what you’re willing to lose. Now the fiat transformed into currency and XRP was approved in US for a reason especially coinbase. There’s a reason why xrp was sued and trust me it’s exploding. Never say it’s impossible look at bitcoin no one believed it will surpass above 50K, so the fiat’s burned to produce and allow more coins to exceed higher. 

I also purchased dogecoin $200 bucks and sold at 15k now I have a second home.

Purchased 1 btc for $350 and gifted to her sibling whom learned trading and will retire next year.

So ultimately with my current investment of $50 xrp will pay off my first home or with $110 xrp will pay off both houses. Either way I’m happy. 


Who knew a young dumb naive hs broke and knows no math yet decided to go for crypto because the road to learn stocks was harder turned out crypto was much better choice. 

If you’re bilingual you’ll see it in soap operas or movies too ;) ||| You know what's funny, is that I am pretty sure you are one of those people that actually think market cap matters at all. I am getting tired of trying to explain to people that market cap means literally nothing. Blows my mind how confident some of you are in using market cap as a meaningful metric. 
It's just a random formula and means nothing. 
On every other product in this world nobody cares about market cap at all. Nobody cares about the market cap of diamonds, or apples or lambos or watches but somehow when it comes to crypto people suddenly think it matters and they think they are so smart when they say"" price can not reach x because of market cap"" I facepalm every time because it is so unbelievable stupid....
The only thing that matters is supply and demand and nothing else. ||| Market cap does not mean anything. We already have a price per coin. Why do we need the same information? ||| When i invested in crypto BTC MC was $100billion. People were saying the same thing back then that it will never breach $1trillion, blah blah blah. It's such a terrible argument. ||| utilization ||| not worth. ||| more.xrp please ||| bro u know xrp is king ||| market cap means nothing to xrp ||| utility.  xrp to surpass btc. ||| you don't xrp. ||| market cap means nothing to xrp. ||| [removed] ||| some day some day ||| Mc doesn't matter with xrp ||| market cap doesn't matter silly goose ||| yea you silly goose ||| 7 xrp @ 3.41 ||| well, trump and xrp will come to save you guys in the north next. ||| MYYY GUYYYY ||| I'm just trying to get out of mom's basement .lol
 on another note, I've stated this was a joke that just blew up for fun a couple time and it just doesn't stop. no such thing as bad publicity ||| I mean... When the ""Over 9000"" memes hit for BTC, did you ever think it would be stalling at 11x that amount? ||| What Bitcoin is NOW. You have people out there mathing how Bitcoin will get to 1mil, 15 mil, all kinds of insane numbers. ||| I don't get the comparison vs. Bitcoin. How do you rationalize Bitcoin's market cap when it's not even being adopted by any institution? Is it for the black market and money laundering where huge amounts of money are being moved? If so, is the black market bigger than the global payment system?

XRP can and would surpass Bitcoin's market cap if there is enough proof to show that XRP adoption becomes bigger and wider than Bitcoin adoption. Sad to say we cannot get a good grasp of how Bitcoin is actually being used in the institutional sense so the comparison is basically moot and inconclusive.

Estimates based on global transactions via payment systems are more plausible to be used as basis for XRP's price as they best represent its use cases. ||| lots of markets to go in.  it will surpass bitcoin ||| lemme save u a dollar ||| TRILLIONS ||| you don't xrp ||| Go back 4-8 years and you will read the same in other subreddits. It’s not that it’s absolutely not gonna happen, just that speculation leads nowhere ||| [deleted] ||| aw yes took some time but we fuckin did it ||| ![gif](giphy|ToMjGpnXBTw7vnokxhu) ||| Their own ||| Dreams come true ||| Check profile the are there ||| Not the person you responded to, but I've owned XRP for like 7 years now. Got a fat bag and have added to it over the years. Still think you and most of this sub are delusional when we're still below our 2018 ATH. I'd much prefer slow steady growth through use cases than these spikes that balloon my account balance but feel so temporary that it's taking all my self control not to realize gains. ||| You ripple mfs getting real cocky ||| I bought it at the high back in 2017 so I am just breaking even at this point. ||| Well it's cause they said ""calm your tits."" If just said ""calm 1 tit, let the other run wild, your party tit"" they would have got it up. ||| Market cap tells you how fat something has grown and how slowly it will grow in the future. Obviously, don't look at marketcap in a vacuum. You need to consider demand as well. Bitcoin doubling in a week is basically impossible at this rate, it will take far too much capital to move something with such a fat marketcap (1.5 trillion) unless it had insane demand. ||| Interesting thank you ||| Thank you posting something with value. I learned. I really appreciate the reading.

The link is faulty. Either that or you are stealing my identity right now. ||| You are genuinely slow if your takeaway from this is to completely disregard market cap. This is why you people round trip millions yearly. ||| About 127 billion according to Coin Market Cap ||| Well, if you don't play it smart and keep acting smug you're going to lose it all. 

There is no guarantee xrp wins as a settlement option. ||| Pizza order inbound... ||| ETH likely will pop off soon. ETH historically follows BTC but is slower. Also there’s something about ETH ETF that people are hesitant about but hopefully will soon heat up ||| Honestly no specific reason lol. Years back I bought like $500 in ETH and then $1k of alt coins including some XRP on Binance. Then the whole [binance.us](http://binance.us) thing happened and I never transferred anything and over the years assumed it was lost. I had the ETH on another exchange. Randomly the other day I spent some time handling everything and got it all transferred to the US Binance site and then I was like fuck it and traded all of it for ETH and figured I'd leave it there. ||| That's exactly the reason. Most other alts have already sky rocketd and who knows if they will go much higher from here. Where as ETH hasn't really taken off yet. Not a bad play to pull profits from other moves and put it into ETH. ||| Huh? You’re over thinking this just a little bit lol ||| Go touch some grass ||| I mean long term it will be fine but tempted to trade some for XRP ||| That was my mistake. I could have made more. ||| Many already using it or ready to use it. I am just being conservative 😂. Let this moon for real ||| To be fair, everything in stock is a gambling. If we actually know, we all would be a millionaire. I would already go all in. And it doesn't matter how good the company is, let the CEO f up couple times, the stock would go down the drain. So yes, it's gambling 🤣 ||| Enjoy it man. I definitely believe it's possible for sure, but In order for that to happen everything has to fall in place 

Something big is coming tho ||| Good Bot. ||| idk let's get some exposure ||| they don't know we know but fuck these guys ||| $100 price tag on XRP is 5x the size of Bitcoin.. seeing as Bitcoin doesn't do much and XRP is taking market share daily in the payments space, doesn't seem all that unbelievable to me...by the way this is assuming that all 100B XRP were in circulation which only about 60% is .. so a 5T market cap would put XRP at $100 right now, about 2.5X Bitcoin size. ||| A token created by three people in 2012 is not new tech ||| Also they can and are burning coins ||| I pass 8th grade math just gimme money ||| I’ve been reading many comments like “I don’t understand this, no one does”. Sorry it’s not 2017 anymore, Wall Street is here and they have billion dollar algorithms, super computers, AI and more, and if you really want to know who they’re working with, it’s public information you can find yourself (p.s. it’s not xrp) ||| closer to quad ||| I would love to see a source for this information so that I may read more about it ||| Correct ||| you xrp I like you ||| Idk, I just don't see how there can't be some cap on the value of the supply. If it hits $100 it becomes as valuable as something like 10% of the entire GDP of the world. You're telling me all of a sudden the subset of people who own XRP hold as much wealth as 10% of everything everyone produces on the whole planet?

Maybe I'm wrong, but that's just my thought process. You have companies with trillion dollar market caps but they have products and things that societies and global infrastructures are built off of. XRP is useful, that's why I've chosen to have it since 2018, but it's not as important as things like computers. ||| Ive made more off of XRP than you can fathom. use ur brain next time and get this trash off the sub ||| Lolololol GER. We got a smart one here ||| Could you elaborate ? ||| Utility of what ? What is it going to do ||| Oh okay..i thought.. alright,  gotcha ||| you don't understand xrp then ||| Yeah. math is not an exact science -_-


 Don't be delusional,  be realistic ,if he can go that hight thats on the next 50 years ||| Nope they didn’t, they’d be too rich to be bitching on Reddit lol ||| XRP has a supply of 100,000,000,000
BTC has a max supply of 21,000,000 

Way easier to 10x the lower of the ywo ||| How long have you been in this space?

What's in the pocketoli? ||| Not really, we havent even breached ATH. ||| True, but not if you're daydreaming ||| You must be new here lol ||| Can attest ||| Don’t talk about ur gf like that! Fat bag indeed. ||| You’re not factoring in your opportunity cost as well. You really fucked up ||| xrp>tits ||| Exactly this. You worded this pretty well. ||| Exactly. And how much money would need to flow in to move XRP to $5.7T ($100 price, current circualation)? ||| Sorry about that. They posted a version 2. If you click the arrow in the top right corner then blogs, scroll a bit and you’ll see the article “The Myth Of Market Cap” ||| Right now the market cap is 150b with XRP @ 2.6ish. The market cap doesn’t mean anything. How can the cap be higher now than back in 2018 when XRP with at its ATH (apx 3.8) ? ||| Won already ||| just some xrp exposure lol ||| and wings sir ||| Yeah I mean it follows BTC like every other coin but and I’m going to hold mine I just don’t see it being a big mover unless something happens ||| Same here.

It will only allow me to withdraw 922 xrp at a time because of kyc limits and that would take me months. Been running in circles. Would really appreciate some help. ||| I don’t see ETH going that high tbh, but I have 1 ETH so I’m cool if it does, but it’s not going to gain as much as these other coins have ||| I dont think so bud lol ||| Aww did you miss out on profits too? Hahah ||| you sir xrp ||| thanks you sir. you xrp as well. you understand ||| We should fire up 36 nodes and start our own XRPS (XRP Secure) if the valuations goes that high. ||| This is false. David Schwartz already said it doesn’t even make sense to burn Xrp. Why would you burn the greatest financial tool known to human especially when you own the lions share? However, there is a natural burn and it’s through transactions, which is why Xrp cannot be $1 if it’s going to be for the internet of value. Remember Xrp is fractionalized just like most other crypto. ||| Whose they? ||| https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/17136431721993 ||| I fully agree with all of that. I’m thinking about it too. 

Thanks for hearing what I’m thinking instead of thinking I was being a douche.

Here is where I have gotten to with the max price for XRP…
What if it is more like a commodity? A utility token? What if XRP has value because of the use / function it performs? 

Do we agree that it is the native token of a blockchain platform that COULD revolutionize the way financial institutions make transactions around the world? 

Appreciate the conversation.

Also, I am not saying 100$ is a possibility. I have no price predictions. I do think the price of XRP will be more in the future and the % increase will outperform any other investment I could make at the moment. ||| Here is something I found when I think about the price possibilities, “supply” and how demand regulates disbursement of the total amount of XRP in circulation.

https://xrpl.org/blog/2017/explanation-of-ripples-xrp-escrow

I “think” it is reputable, but this conversation is making me follow another area I want to learn more about.

I am not an expert nor think I am more intelligent than anyone else. 

To be honest, I think I am wrong and fully expect to lose every cent I put in. 

I did enough research and could not find a flaw yet. I’m still looking for the flaws. ||| it's 2.50 you didn't make thhhaaaaat much ||| That is your response? How mature of you.

Only got 300€ in with 1.8 avg right now but hoping that this is just the start and in a year or two, XRP could be huge. ||| only you will know if you should buy at this price ||| I just sold some BTC and Solana and bought Ripple over the last few days. I'm at 2000 now. Every time I see the third red candle I buy, but that's not working. Should have just bought all at $1.60 🙈 ||| For all you guys asking to buy....  please learn to trade...  

For all the salty dogs who did our homework, yes, were buying through whatever tops we all individually have chosen...  im dcaing to 5 bucks.  I just bought 60 more and hour ago.

But that doesnt mean anything to you because I have an exit plan, and you're only asking when to buy buy buy and don't really understand what you're doing. 
It like watching a dude throw spaghetti at the wall and using that to trade their hard earned money...

Calm down. ||| Buy high sell low ||| How long do you all intend to wait.  It's been seven years since it's ATH of $3.20 and it has only cracked $1 once or twice since then.  They've made partnerships with international banks and other businesses and it isn't moving the needle.  I believed in XRP too, but if I want to wait 10-15 years for something to produce, I'll invest in blue chip stocks with a good history like apple, nvidia, tesla etc. ||| Buy it, which according to the graph tends to continue rising ||| xrp is easy 100 ||| $100 by the new year ||| Definitely if u want gains ||| Hi guys i now is so ATH in xrp. I want to get some a long term should i buy here ? ||| Load up now ||| I DCA in until I’m ready to DCA out. ||| Buy more ||| Buy and sell. I would do some scalping and sell before it goes back down.

Its not too late, just the wrong time imo... it will probably go higher, but it does not make sense to put all you eggs in one basket when the train has left the station. ||| We flipped tether usdt!!!! ||| lol ||| Buy the dips ;$. There will be pull backs as people realise they won’t get rich over night. This is still a long term hold in my eyes. The real bull run will be 2029 ||| I hope so too!

That piece of junk isn't moving ||| So whats the ticker ||| The lawsuit held it down. ||| [deleted] ||| There are 57 billion coins in circulation!

It's extremely unlikely XRP will ever reach $5 and it's totally impossible to reach $10 let alone $100. ||| >XRP once had a reported price of well over $3. But that price was computed including exchanges where the asset on the other side was converted into dollars using an ""official exchange rate"" that was too high. The real all-time high is about $2.80. ~ David Schwartz CTO of Ripple on April 8th, 2023

https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1644843057953771521?s=20 ||| There's 57 billion in circulation of course it'll get to $100, let alone $1000.... ||| Lol. Work harder, my super performs far better than this - $50k earned in one year through shares. Or put your minimal investments in these coins hoping they'll go up 100,000% into education.

This coin won't be a btc - too many coins. Maybe your $1000 investment now may be worth $1500 in 7 years time. 

To put it into actual perspective, when it was $0.50:

To reach $500, XRP's price would need to increase by approximately 100,000% from its current price of $0.50. This would result in a market capitalization of over $26 trillion, surpassing the combined value of the four largest public companies in the world - Apple, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, and Alphabet.

Lol. ||| It can never hit these numbers. Stop fooling people. ||| Next is ethereum ||| Your whole comment is facts 🙌🏽 ||| what's the magic with 2029? ||| 1. Check how much xrp is supposed to be in circulation. 2. It is not at all said that it will end at 100 billion. 3. The xrp token has nothing to do with the activities of ripple labs. ||| Gosh this is exactly what crypto is not supposed to be everyone thinking about getting rich quick. ||| I wanna say its going to cool off and re-trace.  But you just never know.  
I'm waiting to see if we have a correction. ||| Sold my shib for xrp yesterday. Was just losing money every day on shib since got in pretty late. & honestly, doesn’t matter but XRP coming is way better than shib community ||| Shib has been moving like crazy. 259% increase compared to a year ago ||| I was going to mention that or it might have peaked at maybe $5. But it was deemed a currency and even put back on Coinbase and still never recovered. It's now tracking independently of Bitcoin which is either really good or really bad. I'm not putting any more money in though. You could DCA Bitcoin and make more in the next 5 years. ||| Market cap means nothing in crypto. Market cap is why people said bitcoin could never hit 1,000 because it was impossible for it to have a market cap bigger than major world companies but guess what? Bitcoin is now at 100000 with a bigger huge market cap and it literally does nothing and it’s slow as shit and uses more energy than any other crypto there is. XRP will be $100 dollars. Time stamp this and come back to this comment in 1 year. ||| Btc market cap is 1,89T so its not Imposstble XRP marketcap could be ~600B ||| Say less. In with 20k ||| 10 is a long shot also.. but people think everything is the btc somehow.. ||| Adoption takes time, bank partnerships take time, integration takes time. 2029 is the next bull run and lines up with all this stuff ||| There will always be a correction, but I don’t believe it will be a huge correction. ||| Remindme! 1 year ||| Remindme! 1 year ||| When XRP hits 600B there'll be 100 billion coins in circulation and the price will be $6.

Get it now? Even if it's the same 57 billion circulating right now the price would be $8.

XRP has too many coins. It's scarcity that drives prices up. XRP was born dead. ||| I’ve always said there is a ton of suppressed value.  We ratchet down when everything else does, but rarely move up.  I bought heavy at .25, my DCA is around .35.
I get burned every time I chase - so at this point I’m along for the ride.

|-|-|-|-| ||| Good points, but i think Ripple has positioned themselves perfectly (they have a extremely experienced team that has deep connections in the finacial domain) and that position will now bear fruit. With all the deals, contracts and partners they have, when the ""machinery"" gets turned on and the tech gets going, the value will show itself. How far the price will go is hard to tell for me, but i think they have stabe footing in the industry and will become a giant. ||| No, this is wrong lol. People once said Bitcoin could never hit $1000 because it would be impossible to have that high of a market cap then it hit $1000 and people said it could never hit $10,000 because market cap and now it’s sitting at $100,000 with a market cap of over 1 Trillion and it does nothing and is slow as hell and uses more energy than any other crypto. XRP can and will be $100. Time stamp this and come back in a year. Market cap doesn’t mean anything in crypto. ||| I have an auto-buy set up, so my DCA is like .63 now, but I’ll just keep putting in my order every week until it’s worthless and I’m buying like .001 or something LOL",81,83
Reddit,XRP,1h3r381,2024-12-01 00:50:10,"RLUSD and XRP So if RLUSD is approved, what effect will it have on the price of XRP?","Hopefully it goes up. ||| RLUSD is going to add liquidity to XRP, so essentially raising the price. but how much no one knows.. its not a bad thing. ||| If RLUSD gets approved, it could have a positive impact on XRP, but it depends on a few things. RLUSD is likely to increase activity in Ripple's ecosystem, and if that happens, it might boost demand for XRP as part of the network's infrastructure.

XRP’s main use is as a bridge currency for liquidity, so if RLUSD drives more cross-border transactions or improves RippleNet’s adoption, XRP could see increased usage. On top of that, approval of RLUSD might signal regulatory confidence in Ripple, which could improve market sentiment and attract more investors to XRP.

That said, if RLUSD ends up reducing the need for XRP in some use cases, the impact might not be as big or could even go the other way. It really depends on how RLUSD is integrated into Ripple's ecosystem. ||| Get both ||| I am also confused on this.  If XRP token isnt the token that banks are holding/transferring, why does the value of XRP need to increase?  I'm asking as a holder and believer of XRP since 2017, I've always loved the use case but the new stablecoin scares me a bit. ||| It'll probably be like everything else where you buy the hype and sell the news ||| It’s clear to me the banks wanted a stable-coin. ||| What does that mean, ""add liquidity""? ||| You misspelled beer ||| You won’t  be able to buy RLUSD, its not meant for minorities as far as I’m concerned. ||| They also need #XRP to process the RLUSD to fiat or to buy RLUSD, banks NEED XRP to use. Otherwise, they have to use like a financial service which will cost more for the transaction .. ||| So normally when people want to pull out of crypto to either hold their funds or avoid a drop in prices, they sell for a stable coin. Usually that’s when usdt is bought, and their market cap can get really high during a bear market. Because people don’t want to leave crypto completely and have fiat.

Usdt is a stable coin on the ether block chain, it kind of props up ether a bit. But I think Brad garlinghouse mentioned in an interview that the sec is now going after usdt and ether, it would make sense for ripple to have a stable coin for people to use. 

I think this interview was before Mr trump won the election. No one really knows what the sec will do in the future right now. ||| RLUSD works on the XRP Ledger and the XRP Ledger works on/through XRP ||| I believe it will increase the funds available and make it easier to buy/sell...

Recently Coinbase has enabled XRP again and I see that my balance is not correct, despite my past transactions showing up from 2020.

Moon baby moon! ||| We don’t need another fucking stable coin ||| xrp to 100$ ||| It's happening live as we speak! ||| RLUSD isnt a 'competitor' to XRP. RLUSD is a digital, fully backed dollar.

180 currencies worldwide (approx).

With XRP only one currency combo needed.

Once RLUSD is approved, the banks may allow you to take your 500bucks in and exchange to RLUSD etc so then you have a digital payment method for blockchain (XRPL and ethereum) transactions. It could be the on and off ramp which currently has a significant effect on crypto adoption. Perhaps in time your employer will also pay in RLUSD etc. ||| Well, you see, it won’t. That’s how.  

 These headlines about the big things that *Ripple* is doing have been duping newcomers into investing in *XRP* for years, because they think they’re the same project. None of Ripple’s previous deals have turned XRP into the next BTC (Western Union? Swift?), and a new Ripple *stable coin* project operating on a different chain won’t do it, either. ||| This is my thought too.   I think people will start pull $ from XRP to RLUSD for profit.

If I can swap my XRP to RLUSD and exchange that at a bank for USD, that would hopefully solve a future problem for all of us when cashing in. ||| >the banks may allow you to take your 500bucks in and exchange to RLUSD etc so then you have a digital payment method for blockchain (XRPL and ethereum) transactions.

You're asking a crystal ball question.  I think the correct answer will be, yes, xrp will absolutely rise in price going forward, with hills and valleys as any other.  

I'm planning on holding for 10 years, give or take, until it reaches a target of about 100.  Whichever comes first.  That's the long term exit plan.

Since I'm averaged in at about 1.20, my short exit plan is if it retraced back through to 2.00, then for every 20 cents i will withdrawal 25 percent of my stake.

Then get back in when the dip goes north again...

Reddit,XRP,1h1y5eb,2024-11-28 15:17:38,"Potential Ripple IPO Valuation 2025 Things are looking pretty rosy for Ripple at the moment. There's a reasonable chance the appeal is going to be dropped altogether and even if it isn't not only is it relatively toothless, the new more-pro crypto heads of the SEC and CTFC, I doubt will push it as far as the Supreme Court.

Garlinghouse has always said the two things stopping an IPO were a) the lawsuit and b) a hostile SEC, both appear to be coming to an end in 2025. With all their new projects like the RUSD and probably the most friendly administration towards crypto in history *and* the general upbeat-ness of crypto in general at the moment. It seems to me that in the near future will be the perfect time for the CEO to announce their IPO.

I have some shares through EquityZen and I can see no one is selling them for any less than mid-$40's or about an $8B valuation. Only a couple of months ago it was half that. Even more interesting there were several sellers, I checked today and there are just two. One selling for mid-40's for common shares and a guy selling preferreds for low-$60's ($12B valuation).

Now, officially Ripple has a valuation of $11B after the last share buyback in Jan, but with recent developments in the cryptosphere I think it's safe to say we're looking at a figure quite a bit north of that on the open market.

Questions is though - how much north?

The most brilliant scenario is that Ripple is valued much like Microsoft Solutions (MSTR). MSTR are a piece of shit company, but they own a shit-ton of Bitcoin as well. So, despite not being profitable they have a ridiculously high valuation of around $80B.

Coincidentally, Ripple holds about 80 billion XRP or a current value of approx. $120B. Naturally, with a more friendly crypto environment, no lawsuit etc this figure/price of XRP it's highly likely that this value would significantly increase.

Probably a more realistic view is that Ripple gets a boost from holding XRP, but it's valuation isn't fully impacted because they are quite a bit more limited than MSTR with distribution.

Thing is though this is a very roundabout way of saying I haven't a foggiest on fair value! And if you ignore all the scammers and shills finding any realistic targets from people more well-informed in surprisingly difficult.

What are people's thoughts? What do you think might be a fair valuation of ripple in 2025?","It's weird to me that on a forum for the actually company in question, which has been viewed 9,000 times, the only responses I've pretty much got about an IPO/valuation is two people wanting to defend MSTR over a throwaway remark. It's disheartening to think I could have posted 'Is it tooo late ti buay?' and probably gotten about 30 responses. ||| I feel like I researched this a couple years ago and found some decent arguments for valuing Ripple if it were to IPO. I pulled the trigger on some share back in April of this year for about $39/share from Linqto, but that was before the price explosion of XRP. Shares have been sold out on there for a while but now are back and they are going for $116/share giving it an implied market valuation of $20B. 

But I was under the impression that Ripple holds closer to 55 Billion XRP in escrow. 

Anyways, as someone alluded to below they couldn't ever just sell it all, so that makes you have to discount their holdings for their current valuation. However, I look at XRP's adoption, RLUSD's quick adoption and think XRP price could easily jump up quite a bit.

I think the main differences between Ripple and MSTR, is as you mentioned their underlying business. Ripple has a chance to be making an enormous profit if XRP is adopted throughout the world and is fully integrated into the financial system, not even considering their XRP holdings IMO. But like MSTR I think having substantial holdings would give them value beyond the token's worth, via different creative mechanism, such as loans.

IDK its obviously not an easy question to answer but I put it as a high risk high reward bet just like buying XRP, but I think the upside is easily over $100B valuation for the company if XRP is widely adopted, and that would be on the low side IMO. So then I ask myself if XRP continues to be adopted and XRP price continues to rise prior to an IPO, I rather continue scooping private shares now before the market is offered it and could shoot the price up even more. 

  
Here is the article I found last time I researched this btw, and the lady uses Coinbase's IPO as a gauge of how Ripple might do in an IPO

[https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:3ba901fe3094b:0-wall-street-expert-sees-20x-potential-in-ripple-via-xrp-and-ipo/](https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:3ba901fe3094b:0-wall-street-expert-sees-20x-potential-in-ripple-via-xrp-and-ipo/) ||| I think a lot of the valuation would have to come down to their AVAILABLE (i.e. liquid, un-escrowed, market-dilution weighted) holdings of XRP. 

If XRP stays at, say $3, and they have POTENTIAL access to (conservatively) $100m per escrow (per month, ish, I think?), and again we say (conservatively) they use up 10% of it i.e. $10m/month, without affecting the market negatively, then that's $120,000,000 in potential cash flow per year based ONLY on XRP sales (or lending, liquidity provision, market making, or whatever else they can do with it).

Now you have to assume they have at LEAST $1-2b in cash in a bank too, since they had $1b I believe before the court case (which cost $100-200m – ouch!). 

I believe they are also debt-free. 

And we haven't even started talking about non-XRP related business. E.g. transaction fees from ODL/RippleNet transfers or loans, and so on. 

Let alone they own an AI company, are now balls deep in custodial solutions, hold countless software and business IPs... I could go on. 

They are an absolute monster. I personally believe they could be a trillion dollar company one day. ||| how are you buying/selling Ripple? Linquto seems like an option but it doesn’t seem like I need to pay $40/50 per share, it’s like $28/share. ||| I'm curious to know if they would split before listing and or will they pay dividends? ||| [removed] ||| I wanted to take you seriously but I’m seeing credibility issues here.  The least you could do is correctly use the company’s name you are bashing.  Why bash?  If you want to be taken seriously, answer that friend. ||| mark to market 10bn, 15bn at best. if it ipo’s in a frothy market—any guess is a good guess.  30?

it’s xrp holding would be worth pennies on the dollar if it were to cash it in (lack of a bid side at that volume) ||| Mstr isn’t a “shit company” ||| I'm trying to find an evaluation myself. VISA IPO'd in 2008 with an evaluation of $17.9B. Perhaps that could be a conservative number for Ripple when they IPO.

I'm literally on the fence of purchasing some private shares now.

The positive outlook:

1. SEC case is over - imagine the growth once it's put to bed
2. XRP clarity
3. Continual growth/expansion/partnerships during SEC crackdown
4. No layoffs, continually hiring

So yeah, I think a 45%-60% increase in evaluation before IPO could occur if comparing to VISA back in 2008. But I literally know NOTHING about this. I've never invested in private shares before. I'm just researching as you are.

edit: grammar ||| EquityZen - shares are only sold by employees or management so they get to determine what price they'll sell them for. I think you'll be lucky to get anyone currently selling them for $28 a share, but if XRP drops you could get lucky. Mid-40's are currently getting snapped up. ||| my understanding is that Ripple has a right of first refusal for secondary market purchases of either common or preferred stock, so even if you happen to find a price you want to snap up, the company can snag those from under your nose. There is also talk of a potential tender, maybe in anticipation of a planned IPO, so it could be tricky to get a purchase done. ||| I picked up 149 shares for $7500 on Linqto about a year ago. This was based on an 11 billion dollar valuation. I cannot find shares available any longer. I am happy to have them at $50 considering their XRP assets are over 11 billion not to mention the business they have in the pipeline. Valuation of a company is typically a multiplier of EBITDA. Most between 5 and 7X so we could literally see a valuation of 55 billion. Although this is not sustainable, its going to be somewhere in the middle, that I a confident. 

Good luck everyone. ||| Auto-correct changed the name. I'm bashing to make a point. MSTR basically exists to buy bitcoin. That's pretty much it. Ripple actually has a business/technology behind it which are worthwhile. Therefore if MSTR, which is shit, is valued at $80B+ doesn't that suggest Ripple would be worth more. ||| Thanks for the answer. I'm a tad more optimistic, but I can see your logic. ||| Yes, it is. 99% of the company's value is because of it's bitcoin holdings. If it wasn't for BTC they'd probably be bankrupt by now. Just take a look at their financials. ||| Did you end up buying? I’m looking at the same using Forge. ||| He’s right tho ||| That doesn’t make them a shit company. They borrow dollars (which get printed out of thin air) and buy BTC which gets more and more scarce. ||| No I think I’ll wait until IPO and buy the inevitable dip if they go public. ||| About what? ||| That is literally the dumbest take I've seen in my entire life. On every level. I actually feel stupider for having read it. Thank you for playing. ||| What you said . ||| 🤣🤣🤣 OK bud. Why don’t you explain to me why it’s stupid. Because that is quite literally what Micheal Saylor is doing with MSTR. ||| he is saying the underlying business, the one MSTR was founded and ran forever is shit. not their new strategy. you may not even be aware of what MSTR did before buying BTC, at least that is how it seems with your replies, and therefore proving his point lol! ||| Yeah that’s not what he’s saying but ok.

Thank You So Much!!","How long did you give customer service? They will eventually get back to you and ask for proof of identity and address and a selfie. ||| Whew!  I just went through this and Uphold was very helpful, albeit a little slow.  You should start by logging into the account and try and ""reset"" the 2-FA.  I could not get Google 2-FA to work and I use multiple 2-FA apps for work and personal.  Finally, I added it to my Microsoft Authenticator and it worked.

Do the reset from a desktop/laptop and scan the 2-FA with a cell phone.  If you get stuck they will answer from Uphold support but probably in a few days.

Currently, several factors align in XRP's favor, including increasing regulatory clarity, the departure of Gensler from the SEC, industry-wide adoption, and a crypto-friendly stance from the incoming US administration.

Crypto 101. ||| I see you're asking why it went up 100% in the last few weeks! ||| Ok crypto 101, the whole crypto field is about mass psychology of everyone trying to make money and speculate on price moves. It is very resistant to actual real life events and news and only few big things matter and they are usually bitcoin related. Like the US presidental election that started this run.

 Every crypto has its own echochamber foaming at the mouth about how their coin is the future of the world which makes them resistant to bad news and at the same time also to good news because good news are everywhere when you're foaming but at the end of the day all these big moves are dictated by bitcoin. When it surges one way, xrp among others follows. This is what has happened here. Bitcoin is in pullback after a bull rush so xrp is in a pullback. Bitcoin made a new all time high and now we have uncertainty on the direction, so we're hovering. The question you want answered is ""do you believe bitcoin has enough sentiment to break 100k?"" If so, then yes you should buy more xrp. If you believe bitcoin will resist 100k, then no. 

Me personally? Since we're still so close to the new bc all time high, I won't be buying more. I don't trust it will rush higher after already climbing so aggressively without a more significant pullback. Which would mean xrp is going to get cheaper to buy before next bull run. ||| Then stay away, don't force things ||| Still waiting for that decoupling! ||| Why did it go up over 100% in the last few weeks?

\- The move places the XRPL as one of the leading blockchains for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and institutional Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

\- *""The arrival of abrdn’s money market fund on XRPL demonstrates how real-world assets are being tokenized to enhance operational efficiencies, while further reinforcing the XRPL as one of the leading blockchains for real-world asset tokenization,""* said Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President, RippleX.

\- According to a report by McKinsey, the tokenized money market funds market has reached an impressive milestone, with assets under management now exceeding $1B.

\- Moreover, looking ahead, some forecasts suggest that the total value of tokenized assets could skyrocket to an astonishing $16 trillion by the year 2030. This remarkable growth underscores a burgeoning demand for innovative financial solutions in the evolving digital finance landscape.

\- Ripple will invest $5M in tokens associated with abrdn’s Lux fund. This investment marks a significant milestone as part of a broader initiative by Ripple to channel funds into Real-World Assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

\- This larger fund will be managed by a diverse group of experienced asset managers, reflecting Ripple's commitment to enhancing the utility and integration of blockchain technology in traditional financial markets.","only XRP could get good news like this and drop in price. ||| Anyone know what the date of return could be on this? 6+% would be nice ||| I just have 80 Xrp left 😩😩

Reddit,XRP,1gzbzfa,2024-11-25 05:50:17,"Case report day 2285  Well, at this point, there aren’t any daily discussion threads to comment on.

Six years ago, a 20 year old me stumbled upon XRP through trying to buy something on a part of the internet where only cryptocurrency could be used. It was only when I was forced to pay with bitcoin that I realized cryptocurrency was…money. 

Since that point, and since I learned what XRP was, and what Ripple was doing with it, I made a decision to center everything in my life around getting every XRP I could at such low prices. I knew that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I knew that putting everything else to the side in my life would pay off exponentially down the road. I knew cryptocurrency as a whole would become more mainstream, but I knew more specifically that XRP was fundamentally rock solid, and grossly undervalued. 

Every single day, for years, it’s all that mattered. I didn’t care about my social life, I didn’t care about a relationship, I didn’t care about my own mental health even, I needed to get every single dollar I possibly could and put it into XRP. Some would’ve equated it to going to a casino and putting it all on red, but i knew this was a risk to reward unlike any other in human history. 

Most would’ve thought I was crazy. I knew I had a better path than going into college and debt, making decent to good money and putting it all on the line. I knew I was prepared to execute a 5+ year strategy to see this through. 

2021 was an amazing year for me, I saw my dreams come true. I also invested in Vechain on a fundamental basis and watched it go from half a cent to 27 cents. I was in awe, but I held through the bear market cashing out essentially what I had invested before the downtrend. After watching XRP and Vechain do literally nothing for years, it was a hell of a ride. I knew it was only a matter of time before it recovered, and it was back into accumulation mode. 

Ripple won the lawsuit, Gary Gensler is on the way out, every single piece that has needed to fall into place, is happening. I never fully knew how my life would transform, but all I know is I’m happy that I did everything i did now. All I have to do is…nothing. This is all just getting started, and it’s all just speculation. We don’t even have utility on a real level creating a price floor. We just have everyone starting to realize this is the future. That the way everything else has advanced in every facet of life technologically, the entire money settlement system of the world will also advance and change, it is only a matter of time. 

I still could be wrong I guess, but I really don’t think so ;)","A gamble indeed, but sometimes you win. Well played, now hodl! See you on the moon ||| Dude I remember you from back in the day

Eth will take some time. With a market cap at 5 times of XRP, we are looking at $7+ xrp.
 We should have some resitance at $1.5, $1.9, $2.1, $3(psychological all ATH). Post that is uncharted territory. 

We would have to be adding $350bn,.something that took Eth almost 7 years.

Prior to Ripple being targeted by the SEC, XRP was often the #2 coin in market cap. With GG resigning and the potential of the SEC appeal being dropped we’ve seen significant price action in the past few weeks. To get back to #2 spot XRP needs to increase x4.6 from today’s value.

Trump WILL have a crypto friendly SEC chair. He wants to have bitcoin as a reserve and holds a lot crypto himself.

As a result, pro crypto regulations will be passed. Elon is part of DOGE (department of government efficiency), and this lawsuit is costing Ripple over 200+ million and the SEC is spending millions of taxpayer money in legal fees . Elon AND Vivek are pro crypto. They’ll put pressure to drop it.

Check the last line of your Toast Wallet backup code, there should be an 8 character word in parentheses. Use that as your passcode and you should get to the next page where it just asks for your back up code.

Trump has been talking a real strong crypto game. Like him or not, if he is to be believed, then crypto will have a much easier time in the US moving forward.

Choose a Wallet: Download and install a compatible wallet application that supports XRP, such as Ledger, Trust Wallet, or another reputable wallet.

Select the Recovery Option: When setting up the wallet, look for an option to recover or restore a wallet using a seed phrase.

Enter Your Seed Words: Carefully enter your seed words in the exact order they were given to you. Double-check to ensure there are no typos or missing words.

Confirm and Access: Follow the prompts to complete the recovery process. Once done, you should have access to your XRP wallet and funds. ||| I am not the proprietor of all information.

I purchased a few hundred dollars worth of XRP way back in 2017 and was wondering if I could get some assistance trying to recover it, since the desktop client that I had used back then to access it no longer exists. To be honest, I'm not even sure this is possible, since the only thing that I have is a single file containing an 808 character string starting with ey and ending in 0=. I ran the string through a 64 bit decoder, and got a string that looks like a JSON file with the fields:

iv, v, iter, ks, ts, mode, adata, cipher, salt, and ct.

I've hunted through old reddit threads and was able to find one or two people that got about as far as I did, but the trail went cold after that.

An interesting thing that I found was that using somebody's algorithm that I found online, I was able to use the original ""ey"" string to determine the password that I used for the ripple, so I have that at the very least.

Does anybody know if it is at all possible to access the XRP? Or is this just potentially a lost cause?

Thanks so much!","Not sure, but I would just see if you could import whatever you have into xaman wallet. ||| 2017 was still a year when security was not taken to the maximum.

I've been doing more research around the web and I'm almost entirely certain that the wallet is recoverable from this string because I've run into several git repos that seem to be made specifically for recovering old XRP wallet files, and they take the specific wallet file that I'm in possession of (with the string starting with ey and ending in 0=). 

It seems like all of them take in the wallet file, a password, and a username/walletname. Unfortunately, I've run into a bit of a dead end since I possess both the wallet file and the password, but have no idea what the username/walletname of this wallet file is. 

I wrote a python script to try to brute force match the user/wallet name to the string based on the decryption codes I've found from these repos and have run through several hundred different options ranging from my own usernames that I use and default names of ripple wallet files, but no dice.

If the U.S. government directly integrates Ripple's technology for its digital dollar and encourages global adoption:
Price Range: $100–$500+
Reasoning: A U.S.-backed endorsement would lead to XRP being viewed as a key asset in the new global financial system, much like gold or reserve currencies. This would trigger immense institutional and retail demand, coupled with massive utility.","xrp does more than just cbdc...rwa, dex, micro, escrow, rlusd, etf, etc ||| Just because we are in the start of a bullrun, doesn't mean adoption happens any faster.

thanks :) i really want to know more about this coin, i think it has some potential","Overview of XRP

XRP is the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), an open-source blockchain designed to facilitate fast, low-cost, and energy-efficient cross-border payments. Ripple utilizes the coin as part of its payment and remittance solutions.

Key Features and Global Use Case

    Consensus Mechanism:
        XRP uses a Unique Node List (UNL) to achieve consensus, avoiding energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) or staking-based Proof-of-Stake (PoS).
        Validators (trusted nodes) agree on transactions every 3-5 seconds.

    Primary Objective:
        XRP was designed for seamless global payments and currency exchange.
        Ripple aims to bridge traditional financial institutions (banks and payment providers) with blockchain technology for instant settlement.

    Transaction Speed:
        Settlement time: 3-5 seconds.
        XRP can handle up to 1,500 transactions per second (TPS).

    Transaction Costs:
        Fees are minuscule (a fraction of a cent per transaction), making it cost-effective for microtransactions.

    Energy Efficiency:
        The consensus algorithm is lightweight, consuming significantly less energy than PoW blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum (pre-Merge).

Key Points from XRP Ledger Paperwork

    Decentralization:
        XRPL validators are spread globally, ensuring reliability and resistance to single points of failure.

    Interoperability:
        XRP acts as a bridge currency, allowing seamless exchange between different fiat and cryptocurrencies without pre-funded nostro/vostro accounts.

    Trust and Compliance:
        Ripple works with regulators worldwide, positioning XRP as a compliant solution for financial systems.

    Built-in Features:
        Support for multi-signature wallets, escrow, and token issuance directly on XRPL.

Advantages in the Crypto World

    Efficiency:
        Faster and cheaper than PoW or PoS-based networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
        No mining or staking, reducing barriers to entry.

    Partnerships:
        Ripple has partnered with over 300 financial institutions, including American Express and Santander, to promote adoption.

    Stability:
        XRP's low volatility and consistent performance make it attractive for enterprise use cases.

    Liquidity Hub:
        Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service uses XRP to provide instant cross-border payments without pre-funded accounts.

Comparison: XRP vs. Ethereum (ETH) vs. Solana (SOL)

1. Consensus Mechanism

    XRP: Unique Node List (UNL)
    Ethereum (ETH): Proof-of-Stake (PoS, post-Merge)
    Solana (SOL): Proof-of-History + Proof-of-Stake

2. Transactions Per Second (TPS)

    XRP: ~1,500 TPS
    Ethereum (ETH): ~30 TPS (Layer 1)
    Solana (SOL): ~65,000 TPS

3. Transaction Fees

    XRP: ~$0.0001 per transaction
    Ethereum (ETH): $1-2 (on Layer 1, volatile)
    Solana (SOL): ~$0.00025 per transaction

4. Energy Use

    XRP: Minimal
    Ethereum (ETH): Low (post-Merge; was high with PoW)
    Solana (SOL): Low

5. Primary Use Case

    XRP: Cross-border payments
    Ethereum (ETH): Smart contracts and DeFi
    Solana (SOL): High-performance dApps and DeFi

6. Adoption Focus

    XRP: Banks and remittance services
    Ethereum (ETH): Developers and decentralized applications
    Solana (SOL): Developers and high-throughput applications

Potential Advantages Leading to Mass Adoption

    Regulatory Compliance:
        XRP is tailored for institutional use, making it more attractive to governments and banks seeking blockchain adoption.
        Ripple’s active engagement with regulators provides an edge over less transparent projects.

    Cross-Border Utility:
        By solving real-world remittance problems, XRP can serve billions, particularly in developing markets where fast, low-cost transfers are needed.

    Energy Efficiency:
        Its low energy consumption aligns with global sustainability goals.

    Scalability:
        With high TPS and low fees, XRP scales well for both retail and institutional transactions.

    Ripple’s Ecosystem:
        Ripple continuously expands use cases for XRP through strategic acquisitions, partnerships, and the development of enterprise-grade solutions.

Summary
XRP stands out in the cryptocurrency world for its focus on payments and remittances, making it complementary rather than competitive to smart contract-focused networks like Ethereum and high-throughput networks like Solana. Its speed, cost efficiency, and regulatory focus position it as a strong candidate for global financial infrastructure.

Created by Albert Einstein in the late 1800’s, he utalized Edison’s theory of “moon shot” to develop a token that through cross border payments will create a “FMO” or face melting opportunity.

So I am aware of market cap and what may be the limitations of XRP. And the range roughly of about 5ish dollars. However why can't it go much higher. Market cap is dependent on variable that I presume can change. Why can't XRP go much higher. Even Bitcoin had a cap at one point that no one thought could be overcome. So what does that say about XRP?

Reddit,XRP,1fglgwt,2024-09-14 12:59:09,"Burns Hey everyone. Ive heard that XRP burns it supply down. Yet, Ive never seen anything about burns that have been done and the token supply dropping down. Just wondering if the burns are true? And if so, why arent they advertised more?","Every time a transaction happens the “gas” that’s used or the fees don’t go to validators. That tiny fraction of XRP that is subtracted from a transaction is what is burned forever. ||| Ripple sent approximately 12 billion to a dead wallet. XRP doesn't have a burn mechanism per se. It's not meant to be burned. A tiny amount is burned during transactions, but not a significant amount. This isn't a bad thing. ||| Yet the circulating supply keeps going up

I think we're getting duped ||| Yes, the burns are true. The primary function of the burning is to deter malicious individuals from spamming the XRP Ledger with transactions. The transaction fees are minimal, typically a little over 100,000th of an XRP. These fees are burned (permanently removed from circulation) even if the transaction doesn’t achieve consensus through the validator network. It does reduce the circulating supply very minimally every time a transaction occurs, even if the transaction is rejected. ||| So, is there a site that shows how much has been burnt? ||| I had read that Ripple has 55 billion XRPs in escrow and will keep releasing a small amount into the market regularly, so as not to affect the price much. ||| You can probably just got to coin market cap and look at the total supply… subtract from 100 billion and there you go. 


https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/


Looks like we are down about 12.5 million or so. ||| Its minimal. but you can look at any major crypto sites. The ""total Supply"" is the amount of coin after the burn. XRP only burned around 13 million coin.

Reddit,XRP,1ff33vx,2024-09-12 13:52:55,Grayscale Investments Launches Grayscale XRP Trust,"that's the bump ||| The launch of the Grayscale XRP Trust could potentially have a positive impact on the price of XRP, though the extent of the effect depends on several factors. Here’s a speculative breakdown of what might happen:

1. **Increased Demand**: The trust makes it easier for institutional investors, and even some retail investors, to gain exposure to XRP. As more people buy shares of the trust, Grayscale will need to purchase more XRP to hold within the trust. This increase in demand for XRP could drive up its price.

2. **Institutional Confidence**: Grayscale is a well-known player in the cryptocurrency investment world, and the launch of an XRP trust could signal to the broader financial community that XRP is a more legitimate or stable investment. This could attract new institutional investors who were previously hesitant, further increasing demand.

3. **Reduced Supply on the Open Market**: Since Grayscale will likely hold significant amounts of XRP in its trust, the available supply of XRP on the open market may decrease. When demand remains constant or increases while supply decreases, prices tend to rise.

4. **Broader Market Sentiment**: If the trust launch coincides with positive news about XRP or the broader crypto market, the trust could amplify any upward momentum in XRP’s price. Conversely, if the overall market is bearish, the trust might not have as strong an impact.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Impact**: In the short term, the announcement of the trust and the initial purchase of XRP for the trust could cause a price spike. In the long term, the price effect will depend on sustained interest from investors in the trust. If the trust attracts a lot of investment, the price of XRP could see steady growth.

Overall, while it's speculative, the Grayscale XRP Trust is likely to create upward pressure on the price of XRP, especially if it attracts significant investment from institutions and high-net-worth individuals. However, broader market conditions and other factors will also play a role in determining the actual price movement. ||| Is there a minimum investment amount?

Reddit,XRP,1erhfsi,2024-08-13 19:53:27,"Ripple's Strategic Partnership with DIFC Innovation Hub to Drive Blockchain Adoption in the Middle East In case you missed it, has recently announced a significant strategic partnership with the DIFC Innovation Hub, a leading technology hub in the Middle East, aimed at accelerating blockchain adoption across the region, particularly within the UAE’s financial landscape. This partnership, with the largest innovation hub in the region that houses over 1,000 growth-stage tech firms and venture capitalists, is set to connect developers and tech innovators with the financial infrastructure necessary to drive their success.

This collaboration has the potential to revolutionize early-stage companies and scale-ups by providing them with access to Ripple’s resources, facilitating the integration of blockchain technology into established institutions. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has highlighted the UAE’s advanced regulatory environment as a crucial factor in fostering financial innovation, stating that this partnership will further accelerate blockchain adoption, with the XRP Ledger continuing to play a leading role in the region.

Ripple has committed one billion XRP to accelerate global use cases on the XRP Ledger, a commitment that now extends to the Middle East. This initiative will provide financial, technical, and business support to developers in the region, reinforcing Ripple’s global strategy. Arif Amiri, CEO of DIFC, described the partnership as a milestone in equipping the next generation of leaders with the tools for success, solidifying DIFC’s position as a global hub for innovation.

Ripple’s Middle East and Africa (MEA) office, located within the DIFC, has already seen XRP approved for use within the Centre, allowing licensed firms to incorporate XRP into their services. This move is expected to further drive blockchain innovation in Dubai. Mohammad Alblooshi, CEO of the DIFC Innovation Hub, expressed his excitement about the tangible impact this collaboration will have on the Hub’s growing community of fintech and innovation firms.

Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasized the UAE’s progressive fintech environment and noted that this partnership would empower regional talent to build the next generation of financial solutions on the XRP Ledger. As Ripple continues its global expansion with this partnership, it reaffirms its position as a leader in blockchain and crypto innovation. This collaboration marks a significant step forward in Ripple’s mission to drive blockchain adoption and innovation in the Middle East, positioning the company to make a lasting impact on the region's financial landscape.

I saw it mentioned that RLUSD will be backed by cash, bonds, etc.

For the transactions taking place on XRPL, is XRP facilitating these on the backend and also as gas? ||| Nice it will make difference in usdt market ||| Tokens can be minted on the XRPL, all gas is XRP for everything. RLUSD seems to be like most stable coins where the actual ‘stableness’ is based on real world assets so that money can be withdrawn without having a bank run. ||| Xrp is used for account/trustline reserves and gas. It is not used to back any asset issued on ledger. ||| ""all gas is XRP"" 

What does this mean? Is it like moving RLUSD you move also XRP or is the transaction cost burning XRP? ||| Every transaction on the xrpl cost a small portion of xrp (0.00001 for now).
You send only RLUSD, but you pay transaction fee.

Actually the concept of stablecoin on xrpl is not new, there is a whole dexfi ecosystem that exists already for a long time, it is just not hyped a lot (but it works great) ||| RLUSD requires 12xrp per wallet as well ||| Like any other token on xrpl.

10 xrp needed for activating an address, and 2 xrp needed to setup a trustline to RLUSD. Nothing new",71,8
Reddit,XRP,1enc8xf,2024-08-08 17:40:34,"Xrp  like I been saying I’m not selling at $1 or $10 nor $100 not even $500 or perhaps $1,000 I won’t even consider $5,000 I’ll check at $10,000 and maybe think about it or better yet $50,000 I’ll consider it….. good luck to everyone!

#XRPArmy #XRPCommunity #XRPHolders #xrp #RippleWon #ripple","its 62 cents everyone the meth is good today I see ||| this guy XRP’s ||| So XRP just gonna up and blow past BTCs MC just like that? I'm all for XRP but I truly think some people need a strong dose of reality. Let's break $1 first and then start talking about $50k ||| I will cut my balls off if it reaches 50k ||| Right. Gotcha. Now I'm holding out for $50,000 XRP. Any day now! ||| I am so hyped for 50,000 thousanddddddd! ||| Some people don’t understand anything when it comes to price/value. 50k per? Come on. Let’s be real here. ||| And what time will that be? 2050? ||| What if XRP starts burning at the rate of 1 Billion coins per year? Even now. with lawsuit and less adoption, 11 Million coins of xrp have already burnt. With supply reducing year after year and transactions increasing, demand will increase. With demand, price increases.
The kind of use case xrp has will surely make it very valuable. But will take 10 to 15 years if everything goes smooth. In Japan, xrp will be used by every bank starting 2027. ||| Let hit the 1$ first before jumping on the hype train. ||| https://i.redd.it/egmpmlrv3lhd1.gif ||| XRP will never hit 10k usd. I dont think it ever hits 100 usd. maybe 5 maybe even 10.  But when people say this 1k 10k dollar stuff its just lunacy. 7 or 8 years in and its never seen 5 bucks. ||| Are you... ok? ||| if it goes to $50K I'll buy you a present. ||| Soon! ||| There are no more catalysts for this coin ||| If it hits $1.50 most of y’all are selling let’s be real. ||| What hurdle are we waiting to overcome now? ||| Ah... Nice month for XRP... Compared to 5 months ago... Hope you guys held or bought then... 😂🤣💪 ||| I would suggest to think that they will come after your xrp soon before price go up  
With many way they can archieve that   
which they have done it all the time   
because they wont want you to get rich and get out of slavery

Be careful guys ||| I've drank a whole bottle of Adderall and I'm not even that delusional ||| Less drugs. These people need less drugs and a daily life outside of crypto. ||| I'm not real sure about 50k but when it goes it's going to go big  like up 100s a week it's already built into the price ||| Consider them gone brother! ⚽️🏀✂️ ||| You won't!! ||| 😂😂😂 ||| @reddit bookmark lol ||| Mine are cut already ||| Youll be dead and long gone. It will be 50k dollars for a pack of ramen noodles by then. ||| That's a lot of thousands ||| 3027... Mark my words ||| Well this will all depends on how the new financial system will work. If xrp gets introduced to Swift and Brics version of Swift entirely, tokenizes all US T-Bills, then tokenize all assets, this could go north relatively quick. That’s all guesses though. We should pay attention to august 19th as well since xrpl will reset and introduce T-bills on the ledger after their 3am system reset. ||| 😂😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤭🤭🤣🤣🫣👏👏👏

![gif](giphy|JUMMXHFcTdF1CZflNv) ||| Not sure about that.  I'm thinking more like $3. ||| My price target is $25. Which means I'll get greedy and hang on for $30, which it will never reach, until it crashes and I have to cash out at $1.50 on the way down anyway. ||| If it goes up 100s a week, I will personally give you 50 xrp.  That's even delusional.  I hope i'm dead wrong and I hope I get to transfer 50 xrp to you ||| Probably could and replace them with titanium. To match",8,40

Reddit,XRP,1eibq1h,2024-08-02 14:39:02,"shit price action, lets give each other smth to be bullish BRICS countries are teaming up to create a new cross-border payments system, breaking away from SWIFT. Ripple is partnering with companies in at least 2 of the member countries (Brazil and India).

SWIFT takes a couple of days to settle transactions and does not work on weekends and bank holidays. Ripple is 24/7, with near-instant settlement.

**TO USE SWIFT, BANKS HAVE TO PREFUND OTHER MAJOR CURRENCIES AND KEEP BALANCES ON THESE NOSTROS ACCOUNTS.**

ChatGPT estimates there are roughly $15 trillion locked in these accounts. **RIPPLE UNLOCKS THESE $15 TRILLION WITH ODL. AND WE KNOW RIPPLE IS PARTNER WITH 80+ PAYOUTS MARKET.**

Feel free to add more thanks for reading.","You can't just pop up and replace swift the same way you can't just replace the dollar. Politics and power, is real. You can't just click into a new system and get out of it, or countries would have done that decades ago.

There are serious consequences ||| XRP is the one.  Imagine when it goes to $100 per coin.  Buy yourself a quality steak dinner every single week. ||| Ripple will do great however XRP will not.  That’s the rub.  XRP investors have funded Ripple to make it and will not reap the resards.  XRP has to be registered as a security to be sold to institutions and the new stablecoin will not and is less volatile which is a concern for banks anyway.  The stablecoin will be used and not XRP.  So everyone talking about XRP as if it is Ripple is full of shit.  Ripple doesn’t give 2 shits about XRP because it has served its purpose. ||| Before that will a collapse occour ? ||| This is top shelf copium ||| Regurgitated shitposting. Please give me actual a use case for XRP not “partnerships” You muppets always use buzzwords like BRICS and swift and vostro. XRP is a shit coin treat it as such it’s not going to replace swift and will prob only hit around 2 dollars again. Ripple sells it everytime there is some profits. And you muppets think you gonna afford a steak each week? Stay broke friends. ||| They are doing it and there will be a day where it will just be different. Things do happen. When? That’s the real question that no one knows ||| It's not capable of spiking to $100, it's not structured correctly to do that. ||| I don't want to hate on XRP here as I hold it, and have done so for some time...but Ripple isn't alone anymore, at least not in Asia and Europe. 

The reality is that where there are market opportunities, others will want their share. 

That isn't to say that Ripple doesn't, or won't, have significant control of certain remittance corridors, and they will likely have significant control of these globally.

I often see XRP holders refer to it as 'the one', perhaps jt was at one tjme, but Ripple has a direct remittance competitor who have made it their core mission to become the Ripple of Asia. 

Many may read this and think the competitor that I refer to is some new start up trying to copy Ripple, but having done countless hours of research into the matter, said competitor is backed by major institutions, including the largest conglomerate in Thailand and they also own the majority share of the 6th largest company in China... and they're partnered with Visa.

Factually speaking, Ripple doesn't have exclusivity in the blockchain cross-border remittance space, even with banks it has partnered with (eg Siam Commercial Bank) where Ripple has agreements for certain Asian corridors and said competitor has agreements in place for others

You can look this up yourself, and the above doesn't detract from my personal view that I think Ripple has a very bright future, but my point is that it isn't alone anymore and competitors exist, including ones with deep pockets, established partners and significant influence via their backers. ||| Tons of variables to consider, but for the Top 10% of XRP wallets this is likely at $30 to $35 per coin.  For the Top 5%, it's likely around $9 to $10.



Long-term, I would suspect the USD:XRP relationship to continue to weaken, as in the USD becomes weaker against XRP. ||| Bought the top didn’t you?

You’re in crypto and you want real use case from an altcoin? How many coins in the top 100 have real use case? BNB? Sol? We only got btc eth etf this year and they only started talking about bitcoin because trump brought it up. 

You want real use case, go buy nvidia apple Microsoft. ||| Can you share the competitors name ? ||| So who else is in the same space as them? What other companies have the physical proof of concept? ||| No actually bought in the .30s and sold when it hit .92c after the first ruling so sorry bro didn’t buy at the top that is for the XRP enthusiasts. I see you have a problem focusing or reading But I’ll dumb it down, you wrote all about brics and swift and partnerships and I said it seems this “cult” relies on these buzzwords but then you reply with this which contradicts your original post. Mental gymnastics. ||| And what other countries are already partnered with 80+ banks and are ISO20022 certified? ||| I'm not going to post it here 1. Because I don't want it to come across as a shill (I mentioned above I hold XRP however) and 2. I don't want to ignite a dick measuring contest between two competing assets.

I'm happy to discuss further via DM if you wish, just drop me a PM. ||| No way will old boy reply. Too much fake bullshit stuck in his head. ||| Get out of here. If you wanna say it then say it.",22,21
Reddit,XRP,1ehn8x8,2024-08-01 17:59:11,Over it. Anyone else just completely tired of waiting for something to happen with xrp. Seems like everytime something might be looking up it just crashes back down. Years and years of this shit is honestly getting real old.,"Yeah I’m over it too. Hahaha. But I don’t sell because I’m just stubborn like that. I’m drowning in debt but clutching my XRP like a gremlin with cookies. ||| Since 2017.... Bored AF. ||| I’m holding until the court case is over no matter what. After that who knows. Maybe keep it or maybe sell everything and get my mental health back ||| I've been holding for years, too. I'm a little annoyed that I could have made a lot of money in different cryptos. I am getting tired, but I'm not selling. I still think XRP will be big eventually. I just wish it would hurry up and do it already. At this point I think the chance to make the kind of money in other cryptos that could have been made 2 or three years ago is passed and there isn't much point in selling to buy into something else. ||| Looks like we lost another million friends, let's pour one out. ||| Yep I've been over it for about 2 years 😅

Escrowed a bunch of coins though so I have no choice but to remain in for the next 30 years. ||| I'm tired. ||| investor fatigue is a real thing for some folks, it depends on what your time horizon is for investments - I am a believer in long-term commitment based on my own research and understanding of the new financial system ||| I don’t pay attention to variations and fluctuations.

Wait until Ripple Vs SEC concludes ||| It’s a set and forget for me ||| I don’t regret buying xrp I just regret buying so much xrp. I wish I diversified a bit more and took fractional profits more, I’m realizing that’s better for my emotional management. Which from what I understand the biggest factor in investing is how well you can manage yourself. ||| Today was a good day :) ||| After waiting years, I sold out this year... think of the opportunity cost. You could have doubled your investment if you just put it in VOO... ||| I could help some of you out. If I chose to buy, it would drop a bit more in price and you could accumulate more. ||| Yes I’m bored annoyed thou that’s only teh hype of we close to settling this lawsuit finally. 
I’ve had a plan to hold all crypto to at least end of 2027 with the reality of the end of 2030 a more realistic to make real gains as regulation markets use cases to be  uikt across the globe via tokenazation gaming defi work Flow tracking etc to be really the thing. ||| Diversify kids, diversify. Also hindsight is always 20/20. It's SO easy to be mad at one particular coin. If you dumped $500 into Bitcoin in 2010 you'd have hundred of millions today. Sure, if you could find it and most of us would have sold WAY before then.

Been a bag holder with XRP for a long time. Lucky enough to make gains on it and OTHER crypto. No one knows when or what other coins, usually shitcoins are going to explode. Total gamble. However spread our your portfolio and you'll 100% be better off than putting all your eggs in one basket. Lastly Ripple has (potentially) the most important utility above most. Bitcoin only still a thing because it's the granddaddy of all coins.

What do I know though? DYOR

In the mean time get hyped with this video. Can't confirm all the info in it, but damn it gets the heart pumping 

[Why do I hold XRP ](https://youtu.be/5urrOWO0KDI?si=QQs4pGkj25VtZq_r) ||| I gave up a year ago. 






Caring about price. HODL. ||| Yep. If I have to hear “better buy this dip” one more time 🤦‍♂️ ||| Watch next time it goes up 10% people go nuts like its going to be $4 by next 24 hours.   It wont get to no $4 its going to go way beyond to hundreds once you see it, it will be too late.  To the moon! ||| DIAMOND HAND 💎✋!!!! ||| IMO, nothing significant happens until the SEC case is completely over. No matter what anyone says on the internet, nobody knows the exact date that will happen. That being said, if I had to guess... it will probably happen ""soon""! 🤣 ||| I pass the time by buying more XRP. ||| Price is a distraction, the value is in the protocol. If you crash out you ain’t gonna make it. ||| I feel like a dumbass for even believing in it. If i would have bought doggit coin I would have been sitting better ||| Nope! Gotta be patient with this one. I got downvoted for wanting to buy more at lower .50 and it looks like I get the last laugh.😎 ||| i got in knowing to be patient and wait until 2030. I don't get why people expect a boom every goddamn Thursday 🤣 ||| Even if it goes up, how do you sell it in the US? ||| Definitely understand the feeling 👍 ||| What makes it even worse is the constant bombardment from ""experts"" saying this is it to the moon.
I believe it will happen but not til the SEC case is over. ||| Yep, parked it. Will check it later and later and later. ||| [deleted] ||| This isn't a meme coin guys this is a real deal with long term use case dealing with serious complications with the sec. Ripple is 100% dumping xrp to keep the company running while they deal with this. Once the who deal is over with, not only will xrp have clear legal definitions that will not only increase institutional and consumer confidence and trust  it will open up further option for future use case. This isn't a get rich quick scheme this is a set yourself up for the future in 10 years thing. You want quick gains take a gamble on the meme coin crapshoot. 🤷‍♂️ 

Tl;dr sell your xrp and buy some meme shit coin and stop crying this is a long game not a quick fix. ||| Crypto period.. btc is about the only thing this year that really ripped.. ||| Getting the supply diluted consistently will do that. ||| And it will be that way until the judge signs the order. ||| Lock it up and check it 3-4xs a year to make sure it’s still there.  We may have won the lawsuit technically but it accomplished their goal to slam the breaks on XRP. ||| But what about ISO 20022 ||| This is 5he biggest bullish signal ever, finally he sells ||| Sold years ago ||| Good luck, I'm liking the odds. ||| Good luck, I'm liking the odds. ||| Here's what I do ... this is not financial advice - it's what I do! When XRP slumps down to ""3-for-a-dollar"" ($.30 something cents), I purchase more, go into DefiPro app in the Xaman/Xumm wallet, put XRP pairs to work in liquidity pools. That way you can make assets while XRP is still low. Download the wallet, explore, and make money while waiting for XRP to do its thing. I Believe that until Ripple is released from the SEC investigation, it will remain as it is. I learned the hard way that money can't be made holding it ... it must be put to work. Money flows, it's currency (current). ||| Did you not see they had BIG news come out over the last two days. When did that happen last time ||| I’m very confident that it’s going to pay off eventually. Until then, I happily just keep buying. ||| I've been entirely out of the crypto space for 4 years. I've been waiting a long time to see a chart this good. The newbie mistake is trading against dollars. On the bitcoin chart XRP has reversed trend and has been trending up for the past 8 weeks now. It's not fast, it's very very slow but it's there. The big wave is still a ways off, it's not going to be soon but it will happen. ||| Last time I said this a moderator banned me from this thread ||| Thats what they want you to feel like & they want your XRP also. you goona give them yours? as soon as you do guess what happens??

I often just forget I have a boatload of it. ||| This must  be a bank fud. ||| You haven’t figured it out yet? ||| Hell nah . Under 1 dollar purchases of XRP is the best feeling IMO ||| Hell nah . Buying xrp at the current price is a steal rn. it’ll be worth it in the long run IMO . ||| I don't sell because it's effort but yeah it's goinbg nowhere. Crypto as a whole has failed to achieve it's potential IMO ||| So bored with the kids roller coaster. I’m about over it too. ||| For fk*n real ||| Hey Brad & David fuck you both ! ||| Hodl it till I pass it to my kids ||| Bored since 2013, but moon or bust. ||| No it doesn't bother me at all. We're talking about infrastructure for a fully digital tokenized economic system. I'm expecting this to be a looooooong slog. I had hoped for short term gains in 2017 when I first started investing, but came to realize just what in the hell they are trying to do here. It's audacious and it will take time to pull off. When XRP finally begins to appreciate, it will be after a lot of other cryptos have been successful. ||| Im hodl with my xrp.
I believe in its utility. ||| I bought 3 large buys of xrp. 

Each time I put that money on the table, I was willing to loose it all. I bought at times, where that money had no importance to me. 

After each buy, I instantly wrote it of as a loss. 

So now I'm just chilling on a rather good amount of XRP. If it goes up yaaaay! If it will go to zero, it won't change anything. ||| Same old shit, time after time. ||| Yes! That’s the moment you realize, that it all was just a gamble and you switch over to BTC and buy something with value. You won’t get rich, but at least you make gains. Just ask yourself where you would stand now if you would have just bought BTC back then. ||| I love seeing these posts, makes me laugh when people just expect to make money as if the price will just go up and keep going up, just for them haha ||| Yeah. It's very old ||| Atleast you get post engagement ||| We need to see about 50 more of these posts and that's usually when it will explode ||| I honestly forgot about Ripple ||| 2030 is the real year when things will look drastically different. Everyone will sell early. All of retail priced out at 3-10$. ||| Yo dude, no-one and nothing owes you anything ||| Crypto isn’t for the faint of heart, if you can’t handle the heat, I agree you should get out of the kitchen. For the rest of us… We know better. ||| What price are you waiting for? It hit $2  on January 7, 2018. We're you in around or before this time? ||| Relying on XRP to moon is why you’re broke. Let it sit. Forget about it and stay disciplined. Work smarter for money and when XRP does moon, you’ll come back to this post and thank me. ||| That’s because nothings ever going to happen with xrp ||| XRP…XRP…..hmm I know that one. Did I not make some nice gains with that in 2017 and forgot about it ever since? 

😬 ||| All the ""Xrp is dead"" bros are really pissed right now 🤣🤣🤣🤣 ||| I hope yall didn’t sell! ||| Glad we finally moving somewhere. ||| Been here since 2020, filled up my bags and I gave myself a decade before I make any moves. XRP is not a meme coin, you will not get rich overnight (but I do hope I’m wrong on that part) and it’s not for weak hands. ||| I think one more year. Ripple is at the final stage of their legal battle. Worst case the SEC will appeal (hence the one more year) and then become the moment the US switches to digital assets. The guys behind this are Harvard guys. The same guys the government runs to when shit guys the fan. ||| Lmao can't believe ppl hold this. It makes no sense to hold... it's so cheap and efficient there will be no need for the price to increase.

Dunno how long ppl in this channel have been in xrp, but they have been marketing and dumping monthly for like 10 years.

You are the exit liquidity. ||| Then sell ||| Tortoise and the hare kids. Tortoise and the hare. Just set an automatic DCA every month and forget about it. We could very well be waiting another decade. ||| So many sad comments lol . Just sell and leave or just stop watching it daily . Check back in when Xrp hits the news ||| I sold over 400,000 xrp and bought SOL. That's the play!!!! ||| You're aware that you can control this, right? Just buy more. As demand goes up, price goes up. Just buy more. And, conveniently, the current price is below what you think it's worth, so you'd be getting a bargain. 

What am I missing here? ||| I mean its a shit coin what do you expect lol ||| User name checks out ||| 💯 same🤣 ||| Since when were gremlins known for enjoying cookies?  Haha. ||| I'm glad I've sold everything last year. ||| Hopefully your stubbornness benefitting you now! ||| Dude me too, i have no insurance…there charging off my accounts ||| You cashed out yet? ||| Yea I’m gonna transfer  to some safe etf and move on. Feels like I’ve been in a pyramid scheme for the past few years. ||| If you are in since 2017 you had ample chance to cash out and even now you should be in 100-200% profit at least….sounds like a good deal to me ||| Same, September 17’ ||| Now what. ||| How’s the mental health now lol!! :-) 💰 ||| Well idk about that, every other month it seems like something totally unexpected blows up 30,000% and turns people into instant millionaires, but having that type of luck is just unlikely. Unless you put money into every single project that opens up which would be a great way to bankrupt yourself 😂 ||| Through different crypto, possibly you would have 10 X . With XRP, you will make 10000X . Patience is the key. Time in market triumphs the timing in market. Mark my words, xrp is the only deflationary coin. And if it is adopted widely, with the level of daily transactions and burns, 1000 Billion xrps are not enough. Its value will keep on increasing.

Edit:
Current burn rate of xrp is approximately 1.8 million coins per year. When people talk about 100 billion xrp, every one conveniently forgets that 5000 xrps are burnt every day. As the transaction volume increases after the case, this 5000 xrp burn per day could accelerate to 50,0000 xrp burn per day this accelerating the value of each xrp. Surely and definitely escrow bag too will be emptied. And then this coin will start moving up like crazy. ||| Even IF it gets posted for widespread use, I don’t necessarily think that will make the price shoot up. Like if the token costs too much, will banks even use it? Seems like a catch 22 ||| It’s so damn fucking frustrating ||| How do you escrow your coins and what makes it different from regular holding? ||| I’m real tired boss ||| Sure was! I’m also buying more on the dip so that’s good too! ||| Doubling my investment isn’t what I’m looking for 😂 ||| This aged like milk ||| Also brother you’re gonna be kicking yourself in the balls for selling. ||| Thats true, seems like 2029-2030 is when everything is going to blow up like the Nordstrom pipeline 😂 ||| 😂 you aren’t wrong that video definitely hyped me up and put my heart at ease that I keep buying xrp on the dip 😂😂 ||| I mean I’ve been invested in it for years so I won’t miss it, but it’s just frustrating to see nothing happen for such a long time with people saying every other month oh this is it this is it lol ||| So once 100% of the supply is reached, at $100 that is a $10 trillion market cap. Not happening, sir. ||| 😂 ya that’s definitely a fact. It’s wild how long these damn lawyers can tie shit up. ||| Still illegal for banks to hold and use crypto in the usa though. What will it do then? ||| FACTS! ||| Hindsight is always 20/20. Key word is diversify ||| lol people downvote for the dumbest shit. I also bought when it was in the 40 cent area recently, so go us 🥳 ||| Lol you‘ve had years for doing that, it‘s time to rise ||| A lot can change in 5 and a half years, companies go bankrupt, new wars, hell maybe even nuclear war 😂 let’s hope we’re all still around in 2030 😄 ||| On any of the exchanges that trade it? What you mean? ||| Yeah its crazy man gonna go up ||| Uphold. ||| What do you mean? You can sell it just fine. ||| Yeah the moon boys don't know that they are the reason it keeps going lower. Pushing up too quickly causes the market to hit a sell wall which consumes all the free liquidity which causes the market to drop. ||| Brother you ain’t never gonna see $100+ xrp ||| lol why are people thinking I sold? I invest every week into xrp 😂 I’m just complaining about it taking too long ||| I’m always honestly worried putting any crypto in staking. I haven’t heard of liquidity pools but I’m assuming it’s kind of the same thing? I don’t know enough about those sort of things and also don’t trust really anything that wants to hold my crypto. You know where I could learn more about this sort of thing? Like deeply into it? ||| Oh? That was a dickmove on their part. ||| No I wasn’t, if I was I would have sold majority of it and waited for the price to drop before buying more. ||| Uhh at what point did you see me say anything about being broke or expecting it to “moon”? If anything I’m able to invest a lot more than most. I invest every week and portfolio grows every week by a significant amount.

I think the stock market whales are going to transfer into XRP/crypto to swap from the old money system into the new one as the global markets and economies have a downturn.

Looking further down the timeline, we may see decade+ cycles that are sort of an ebb and flow from the stock market to crypto and vice versa. ||| Yea I agree they want to push for cleaner energy I believe because our grid is weak so everyone will need their own power plant on their property  the cities will run out of power.

I got 2500 and I’m glad I did,"Why would you have to be accredited? ||| If you buy on a platform like CoinBase you are just buying fractional reserve shares no different than a bank loaning a multiple of the deposits on hand. It’s that simple. ||| omg is this scam still alive? ||| OP, you always needed to be accredited. If you were allowed to do it without being one, that’s the platform’s fault. ||| Because secondary markets are extremely risky and there isn’t sufficient information disclosure from the companies. You don’t own Ripple stock. You own equity in a company that owns Ripple stock.

People only see the “wins” of secondary markets, like with Ripple so far. 99% are losers.

Everyone is always saying “xrp is gonna be big” “xrp gonna hit a couple dollars a piece” and it’s been just back and forth but nothing really significant. Perhaps it’s because of the lawsuit, idk. I’m just tired of missing the right moments of crypto. I know eventually it’ll grow, but that’s a super long term hold. ||| he’s just a little sticious ||| Well no, I’m already invested and was always going to buy in more. Regardless of the dream I just wanted to know what some fellow investors thought about the current state of ripple especially with the lawsuit. Investors that know a lot more then I do about the market and cryptocurrency in general. ||| I dont see him in a tight outfit and a cape yet, so i think he is just plain stitious. Nothing super about this guy ||| Where did you read that trump was given 16million? I know Elon musk is having meetings about it but he’s also having meetings about a wide range of crypto. ||| lol I’m also a Seahawks fan, live in Arizona now but when I moved from Russia to America Washington was the state I lived in most of my life in the USA. I hate Brady too but there ain’t no way I’d giveaway that jersey 😂 ||| I'm not an expert, but neither are most of the people on here who would pretend they are.

I bought in at 11c. I don't have a firm price target, but I'm looking for something in the $10-25 range. You probably know Ripple was sued by the SEC in December 2020. Prior to that, XRP was moderately to strongly correlated with Bitcoin's price and peaked at $3.84 in 2017. We can logically infer that the lawsuit broke the correlation and caused XRP to miss the next bull cycle, so we didn't get a new all-time-high when everybody else did. Had the lawsuit not happened and XRP remained correlated with Bitcoin's price, we could reasonably have seen $12 at the 2021 peak.

We are now nearing the end of the lawsuit (the educated guessers are calling for ""a final verdict by September""). A favorable outcome including regulatory clarity, in my opinion, removes the shackles that kept XRP's price depressed for the past four years. With Bitcoin now at $64k, a price similar to its 2021 peak, I would speculate that puts $12 back in play for XRP.

After the verdict comes down, the smelly cunts at the SEC have 30 days to file an appeal which could blueball us for another several years while we wait for all of that bullshit to get sorted out. There are risks to this: losing the case at the appellate level would set a much stronger precedent and render the SEC less able to attempt to regulate other cryptocurrencies.

Alternatively, the parties could reach a settlement. This has been broadly considered an unlikely result for eleven and a half reasons, including that the SEC can't appeal a settlement, so they might rather lose the case and preserve their right to appeal.

TL;DR: we are likely within 90 days of finding out whether we're out of the woods yet. ||| Nah just be patient 2028 - 2030 will be wild for crypto ||| Boom tish ||| I would say this depends a little bit on your expendable cash currently, and depends on how much XRP you have accumulated to this point. If you don't have at least 20k shares, I would personally keep acquiring more XRP, especially if you have some disposable income or savings. It seems quite clear that XRP is going to be quite an integral part of the Crypto realm as a whole. Maybe do some cost averaging during this time. They are also setting a precedent by taking on the SEC for the entire market the way that they have to this point. I feel it only further cements them into the picture as a foundational part of the whole equation.

I am no CRAZY ""investor"" or anything either. Just a dabbler in this stuff as I do see that the WORLD as a whole is obviously moving towards an electronic currency//getting away from paper/cash. And if you consider the BRICS alliance of these HUGE countries with more joining every month, getting away from the American Dollar... It is too obvious that they would not give one country the sole power again to be the printer of money for the chosen world currency... our idiot politicians messed that up for us!

This also brings up another concern though, and that is having any money sitting idle the next couple years, in cash form... while the dollar is CRASHING hard!!! Our stupid country cannot afford the current interest payment on our national debt!! So it is almost like you want to try and keep as much money in assets and other investments like crypto and the like if you can. It will be interesting to see how the rest of this year plays out. ||| It's a grossly overvalued crypto. If you're into penny profits, then XRP is a good hold. ||| Ripple donated 400k not 16 million. Think this dude smoked his 160k in profits ||| Thanks for this. I wasn’t aware we are going to find out that soon. My only concern is that both parties are at insanely different numbers when talking settlements. Ripple wants 10mill settlement SEC wants 2 billion. ||| Btw in your opinion should I buy more now or do you think a dip is perhaps on its way back down to say .4 or .5 each. ||| Been in xrp since 2021. Buying along the way. I'm up but not that much. Been in long enough to know that no one knows when this shit gonna be over. If ripple wins and sec appeals  I dont think it will last long. IF and I say IF Trump wins he clearly stated at BTC conference he would fire GENSLER immediately. After Jay Clayton and gensler fiasco, would the new head of sec want this hanging over them? ||| That is exactly my thought as well which is why I invest every single week when I get paid. Just really need to figure out where to do my research and learn more about projects and crypto and investing in general. I’m pretty new at this and not very well educated on it tbh. ||| Why do you say that? Where should I be investing in? Obviously BTC is a great long term hold, Solano projects all seem to do very well. Why is xrp penny profits? I thought once this lawsuit is finally over with that xrp is going to make another bull run? Would love to hear your insight. ||| XRP likes to trade in triangles. Go to Tradingview.com, get the ""XRP/USD CRYPTO"" price chart, set the time scale to weekly, set the price scale to logarithmic, plot the following points, and connect them with straight lines:
Triangle 1:
$0.0030 on 8/12/13 (lower left corner)
$0.06 on 12/2/13 (upper left corner)
$0.006 on 9/18/17 (right corner)
Triangle 2:
$0.68 on 3/27/17 (lower left corner) 
$3.40 on 1/1/18 (upper left corner)
$0.53 on 4/14/25 (right corner)
All points are approximate, so adjust them if they don't look right. You'll intuitively know what looks right.

Generally the way triangles work is that the price will bounce around inside the triangle until a breakout happens in either direction, usually near the tip of the triangle. We're in the tip. That makes it very difficult to predict short-term price fluctuations. It could drop to $0.43 and then come back up. It could stay glued to the top line in anticipation of a verdict. We could get a surprise early verdict tomorrow and break out to either direction. Anybody's guess. ||| Two things.

1. An appeal would take, at an absolute minimum, if the stars align, 8-9 months from filing the appeal to the FIRST opportunity for the appellate court to end the case. Most likely much longer, but that's the absolute floor. There's a whole sequence of events for how appeals are handled and there are no shortcuts. If the SEC wants an appeal, say goodbye to the next year at least, more likely two or maybe even three.

2. Before that speech, it had already been announced that Gensler was planning to step down when Biden's term ends, so Trump's promise to fire someone who already intends to quit is a bit silly. Besides that, I wouldn't recommend setting investment expectations based on anything that guy says. Many others have walked that road before and, well, turns out it's less of a road and more of a rug.

Anyway.
I am confident that we will have a verdict from Judge Torres by the end of September.
If we get thirty days of silence after that, we're in the clear.
So I expect by Halloween we'll be saying one of two things: either ""it's finally over"" or ""for fuck's sake fuck the fucking SEC and their fucking appeal."" ||| The lawsuit coming to an end has the same anticipation as waiting for rates to start dropping, it's priced in imo, but that's not the reason it's a penny play.

It's a penny play because it does not have the capabilities to spike to double or triple digits. If it was a low float and low valuation crypto with fundamentals/story execution with revenue potential, you can make millions. XRP is the opposite of that. It's a $30bn crypto trading at $0.5 with no story and revenue generating capabilities. they are no longer unique, their tech is easily replicable, and have hundreds of competitors. 

it also doesn't have the capabilities to attract real big money from savvy investors/wall street and that's because they didn't structure the crypto like a stock when they first floated. cryptos trade like stocks, so structuring it like one is beneficial for everyone with vested interest because the purpose of a well engineered stock is to make everyone involved money. if XRP was a stock, it'd be the only stock in the S&P500 that would be trading in the pennies. this is problematic because armchair investors perceive high price = high value = less volatile and low price = highly volatile = high risk high reward. XRP is a billion dollar crypto that looks like a penny stock. penny stocks if structured correctly and execute, are capable of spiking to double, triple and quads. XRP looks like a penny stock but because of its high float, doesn't have the capabilities of spiking to double triple or quadruple digits like a penny stock. so ripple have fleeced every XRP investor into believing it has the propensity to spike to high prices when it doesn't. we know this to be true when you look at the XRP subreddits and twitter shills, they are examples of armchair investors who expect XRP to go to $100 because its valuation is in the pennies. if you look at individuals who first get introduced to crypto they are drawn to the likes of XRP ,XLM, HBAR etc because they look ""cheap"" and you can get more of them so if it  goes to $50 they'll be rich. this is what the SEC is mandated to protect, investor perception, which is why the SEC probed Ripple in the first place.

Gensler and the SEC are not the enemy, ||| I’ll do exactly that thank you!

Early employees have 99% of their net worth from these stock options and investors surviving winter after winter, put sell pressure on the stock so buy backs are good for everyone invested ||| I don't think so. Both times they stated they would buy up to 6%. Both times it was oversubscribed and only about 3% of shares were repurchased. So that's 6% combined over both tender offers. ||| 6%, 3% i thought ||| luckily XRP doesn't have to go up in value for Ripple share holders to do very well. Even if XRP stays at 50 cents Ripple holds $20 billion dollars worth. This latest buyback is a 300% gain for many share holders and that is at a 11 billion evaluation. If they were valued at just the value of the XRP many holders would see 600%+ returns. If ripple hits $1 your looking at 1200% returns. Personally I'm long ripple and neutral on XRP. ||| I grabbed some too, hoping for the best 🚀 ||| They wanted to buy 6%. So they budgeted for 6%.  bought 3% instead? Both times? 

“The tender offer was oversubscribed and a little more than 3% of the Fund’s holdings were sold in the offering.”

Ripple was budgeted for and bought a total of 12%. It was an open tender. And just as with an IPO anyone could pay for equity and only a few get it, or usually only get a partial allotment, the *funds* were only able to sell 3%.

Hypothetical scenario. Say there were 100 entities. Ripple had put up an open tender but they didn’t know how many would be interested in selling. They expect 50% would be interested. But 100% did. They give everyone a chance to sell, to be fair. So everyone gets to sell 3% instead. But Ripple buys 6%. Both times. Total 12% ||| 3% recently and 3% earlier in the year. ||| You state that ""everyone gets to sell 3% instead"" so how does ripple buy 6%?

To clarify they set a aside a fixed amount of money for the buyback they don't double what they planned to purchase if the demand is higher. In the first buyback they set aside $285 million to buyback up to 6%. They don't then spend $570 million if demand is really high the just buy back fewer shares per participant. ||| They didn’t double. The budget was always for 12% of outstanding shares at that share price. If participation ratio is double of what was expected, per participant share is 1/2 of that, that is 6% over two rounds. Instead of 50 entities selling 12% each, 100 entities sold 6% each across two rounds. Ripple bought 12% from 100 entities instead of 50 entities. 

Anyway, this is not worth arguing over. I’m sure you’ll figure it out when you directly participate in an IPO or are a direct investor rather than through a secondary entity. 

None of this impacts the statement you made in your original post. I agree this is bullish for Ripple (not XRP) investors because they are marking their company valuation by purchasing at that stock price. It’s around 3.5x the returns over the past 4 years, which is pretty good. ||| Where do you get that they budgeted for 12%?
Only about 3% of each participant's holdings were bought back in each tender offer. But your saying ripple bought 6% each time. That doesn't add up. The % ripple buys and the % each participant sell are equal. ||| You’re conflating the % of sales by your fund as the % that Ripple purchased. And you’re assuming that every entity owns the same number of shares. 

You’re also assuming that *every* participant sold only 3% and exactly the same %. That is also not necessarily true. You only know about your fund.  Not everyone. That’s confidential information that other entities/shareholders won’t share.

Let’s say there are a total of 100000 outstanding shares. Ripple is buying 6000 of them. If you own 20000 and I own 80000, and both participate and let’s say you’re selling 2000 and I’m selling 4000, Ripple is still buying 6% but you’re selling 10% of your holdings and I’m selling 5%. You’re conflating the % sold by the fund as the % that Ripple bought. 

The total shares bought by Ripple per round is 6%. Total 12%. Hope this helps.",23,20

Reddit,XRP,1e1u07o,2024-07-12 22:06:28,"Thoughts on Ripple Potentially IPOing on the New Texas Stock Exchange? Recently, Max and I have been talking through this, and I wanted to share it here to get your thoughts.

The TXSE Group, backed by BlackRock and Citadel Securities, is planning to launch the Texas Stock Exchange in Dallas. This new exchange aims to compete with the established New York-centric exchanges and attract global companies.

With around $120 million raised, the TXSE Group intends to register to operate as a national securities exchange later this year.

What are your thoughts on the possibility of Ripple choosing the TXSE for its future IPO?","Why would Ripple put themselves in a situation where they can get obliterated in a corrupt market?
Brad said they have no intention in an IPO in the US. 
I really hope they don’t. ||| If you want evidence of fraud committed by Ken Griffin, just start with his GameStop testimony to congress on national television claiming that he never spoke to Vlad (of Robinhood) … regarding turning off the buy button on the stock. Official court records clearly prove otherwise. 

You can move on to his company literally being banned from china for illegal activities. 

Hell, look up the plethora of fines they have in the us for market manipulation.

This person is the personification of a modern day Madoff ( also, ya…they were buds) you can’t make this shit up. ||| Oh no. I hope not. ||| Nope ||| This would be brilliant ||| As soon as the SEC case closes, there'll be an onslaught of positive Ripple developments.

 ⠀","I mean, who really thought we would be here in 2024 with the opportunity to keep buying at these prices? Not me, I would’ve laughed in your face truthfully when I started buying in 2018. 

The difference is when you can simply realize that regardless of the exact timing, you know you’re going to make out very well at the end of the day. Bitcoin goes down, it tanks XRP, bitcoin goes up, it goes up less. It has zero actual merit based on anything besides the XRP/bitcoin chart, which is now reaching historic lows. 

The second difference, is when I started buying, I knew it was going to be a 5-10 year plan and hodl. I would be very disappointed if we are still here a year from now, but I know how the market works, I know the lack of objective sense the price makes, and I know how the market cycle specific to XRP works. I don’t need to explain the fundamental reason why XRP is poised to derive value from adoption and actual usage, anybody investing more than a happy meal should already know that themselves. 

Some people don’t have more money to buy, some people are tired, some people expected to get rich overnight. These are all legitimate things to experience, however, smart people and successful investors see opportunities that most do not. You don’t make out like a bandit doing what everyone else does. These prices still excite me, and I’ve been buying for 6 years at this point. Sure, I could’ve made more money DCA’ing bitcoin, or I could’ve lost money through inflation holding it in a bank account. The reality is, that I know the strategy I created years ago, has extraordinary risk to reward, and is very likely to pan out very well, and was a long term plan to be executed. 

What happens when the XRP/bitcoin chart reverses trend and breaks major resistances? What happens when ripple finally settles the fine with the SEC? What happens when XRP actually starts deriving value from real liquidity usage? I don’t have a crystal ball, but I can tell you, just from a technical perspective, combined with a fundamental perspective, that I’m pretty happy with what is to come. I will continue to accumulate when financially appropriate at such tasty prices, and a year from now, I think wagyu beef is a daily menu item.

The US is desperate to defend the SWIFT payment system and the US dollar.. Ripple is a direct threat to both.
Ripple get out of the US while you still can.","Driven out of business according to who? ||| Ripple won a lawsuit and recent news are good as well. Everything was droped except ""The plaintiff has alleged that Garlinghouse violated California’s securities laws by professing to be “very, very long XRP” while simultaneously selling “millions of XRP on various cryptocurrency exchanges” throughout 2017."" It is just personal Bred thing and it doesn't affect Ripple's business. Btw I try to be neutral in any discussion and I think Brad should pay for this mistake.

The adults in the room understand that the global financial system is changing and moving towards a more inclusive digitized age (public-private partnerships). Not a dystopian world where all people use only one blockchain. It will use an interoperable system of various tech.

An example would be one of the largest banks in the USA just recently started a promotion for a digital wallet to digitally house your google pay, Apple Pay, PayPal, and something else fiat related.. give it sometime and they will add crypto.

You're about 3 years late on this post. Ripple has won, crypto is becoming the popular vote in the U.S. Both parties are seeing the light on that. As the U.S. has started to see they will be left behind if they try to over defend legacy systems. 

Ripple, their stablecoin and therefore XRP could end up very necessary for the U.S. in this new monetary war. And trust me, they have started to figure out out the fact it's war. Decentralized money that the US can't control is uncharted territory in the modern world. The problem is the U.S. is about a decade late. Crypto is anti U.S. interest, but they should have launched a massive global campaign against crypto at the fall of silk road. But they barely did anything thinking it was a fad. The private banks launched anti crypto campaigns because they understood. But the citizens thought the banks were simply being selfish. Which to be fair, they were. But they were also right to worry. USD losing it's power could result in a substantial drop in standard of living for US citizens and economic destabilization and it could reduce the power of the Fed to help.

And if you are a citizen of the US you absolutely should have been worrying about crypto for the past decade. I know I have been, but I also happen to bet crypto would win out. I'm not a conspiracy theorist saying the US government absolutely is going to use Ripple to have power in the space at this point. But Ripple could be a saving grace for them if they choose to go that route.

It's too late. Crypto is being developed world wide. The U.S. can't stop it and the government knows that. It's either adapt and be ahead of the curve or get left behind. ||| Shut up Gary! I see you.. you Gollum looking fuck.. ||| Ripple is doing quite well outside of America without leaving, thank you very much.

Yeah and meanwhile they've made deals around the entire planet laying the groundwork for being THE international finance technology just fine while headquartered in San Francisco. ||| Power concedes nothing without a demand.

In the most likely scenario that Ripple ends up having to pay a fine, how small would it need to be for you to consider Ripple the winner in this legal battle?","I don’t think the fine really matters. It’s about the ruling for future sales to banks and credited investors. ||| The fine doesn’t really matter. 

Even if it was 1B-2B$, ripple has half that on hand(Brad said 1B in cash in an interview), and an Xrp war chest valued at almost 50 billion at these current prices. What’s a 1B fine when they will be able to sell 50B+ worth over the years with legal clarity.

What is needed is the case to end without an injunction on sales involving institutional contracts (hopefully they will since ripple changed them) , and for no appeal. That would be a win. ||| any amount. lol, ||| I hope they dig in and change their mind and “pay” $0.00. ||| Ripple is only settling for regulatory clarity. Not for any $ amount ||| I'd say a $100 million fine would be a positive for Ripple ||| all of them.. ||| Any amount ||| Ah ok, hm. 
It makes the question a little more difficult I guess, but would you take a shot about the tipping point of a favorable ruling for Ripple vs. a favorable ruling for the SEC ? ||| SEC just reduced the fine to $100m. A 95% reduction. Ripple will probably try and get it even lower. ||| If its „any amount“, then why does the case still matter in any way? ||| They  actually aren’t settling, it’s come down to the judges decision because parties won’t settle. ||| There’s some ambiguity around the actual SECs response to ripples response. Ripples response stated the fine should be 10million if they use the same calculations as the Terra forms lab case. 

The SEC stated that by ripples own calculations using the Terra case, it should be 100M, but not even that would be satisfactory. ||| Because they cant operate in the US until its done. ||| Ah, I think thats the missing information I was looking for. Thx",13,16

I have been closely monitoring the SEC vs. Ripple case since its inception. 

It appears that the forthcoming decision may be the final one. 
However, I am uncertain if this is truly the case.

Can anyone provide insight into the potential legal follow-ups that might occur?

For instance, in a hypothetical scenario where Ripple is fined $10-20 million, which might be seen as a favorable outcome for Ripple, could the SEC appeal such a decision? 

Alternatively, would this be a final decision, effectively concluding the case ?","First, either party can appeal to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. Then, if they don’t like the result there, they could appeal to the Supreme Court, which can choose to take the case or not. ||| Can’t keep up anymore. What dates are important ? ||| The SEC and Ripple can both appeal any decision made by Judge Torres, which will mean the case goes to the Supreme Court. Then they're looking at another 2ish years of legal process. ||| If they don’t appeal, it’s the end. If either side appeals, could be another few years to go. ||| Thinking the SEC had enough & looking for a way to back out, they thought the case would have been won in their favour long time ago, now they facing ETHGate so when the next Court decision arrives Imo suspect it could be a hit to the SEC and they will have to face up to their complete bios & corruption on the entire Crypto system. ||| No date set, the Court will reply at Judgement ||| There’s a cost to appealing, and higher courts need to agree to hear it in the first place.

Assuming that it goes to the Supreme Court, then the SEC risks their loss becoming the rule of the land. They currently have favorable rulings in other jurisdictions. They would lose that.

Ripple would need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to continue to fight their Loss. And if they lose, still pay the fine they’ll be handed. All while detracting from product development and furthering institutional adoption.

That said, I think both would be foolish for either side to appeal the ruling, with the caveat that the judge doesn’t agree with the SEC’s request for ~$2B in fines from Ripple and goes for a lower amount.",10,7

Not suspicious at all. ||| [removed] ||| They are definitely going to ban you for that",3,3
